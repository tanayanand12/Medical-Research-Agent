However, there is a study [NCT05725226] that compares 4Fr and 6Fr sizes for Double J stents in urological procedures, which may offer some insights into sheath size comparisons in a different medical context. No trials specifically addressing transpedal arterial access procedures with these sheath sizes were identified.\n\n### Detailed Analysis\n**NCT05725226** is a randomized, parallel intervention trial focusing on the comparison of 6Fr vs 4Fr Double J stents in patients undergoing urological interventions for urinary tract stones. The study aims to evaluate the impact of stent size on patient symptoms and outcomes using the Ureteral Stent Symptom Questionnaire (USSQ). This trial was conducted at Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital and involved detailed symptom assessments at multiple postoperative points.\n\n### Study Characteristics\n- **Study Designs and Methodologies**: NCT05725226 employs a randomized, parallel allocation model to compare two sizes of Double J stents. The primary purpose is treatment-focused.\n- **Patient Populations and Eligibility Criteria**: Adults over 18 years with sterile urine cultures prior to surgery were included, excluding those with bilateral DJ stenting, pregnancy, or complicated surgical histories.\n- **Intervention Details and Treatment Protocols**: Two intervention arms were used: one receiving a 6Fr x 26cm stent and the other a 4Fr x 26cm stent. Both groups were assessed for symptoms related to the stent placement.\n\n### Key Findings and Patterns\n- **Notable Trends**: The focus on stent size in urology suggests an ongoing interest in optimizing procedural components to reduce patient discomfort and improve outcomes, which could be analogous to considerations in choosing sheath sizes for arterial access.\n- **Variations in Approach**: The detailed symptom tracking and use of a validated questionnaire (USSQ) highlight a rigorous approach to understanding the implications of device size in medical interventions.\n\n### Practical Implications\n- **For Patients**: Patients involved in similar urological procedures might benefit from understanding how different stent sizes could affect their recovery and symptomatology.\n- **For Researchers**: This trial underscores the importance of device sizing in patient outcomes and could serve as a model for similar studies in other areas of interventional medicine, including vascular procedures involving sheath sizes.\n\n### Data Limitations\n- **Unavailable Information**: Specific data directly comparing 4Fr vs 6Fr sheath sizes for transpedal arterial access procedures was not found. The trials provided focused on urological stenting rather than vascular sheath use.\n- **Need for Additional Research**: Further studies specifically targeting sheath sizes in vascular procedures would be beneficial to directly answer the user's query and enhance understanding in this area.\n\nThis analysis is based on the available clinical trial data from ClinicalTrials.gov and does not include trials not listed or registered outside this database.",

However, several trials report on the incidence of pseudoaneurysm in various vascular access scenarios, including transradial and hemodialysis access points. Notably, NCT03645720 focuses on pseudoaneurysm as a primary outcome in hemodialysis access, providing specific incidence rates at 6 months.\n\n### Detailed Analysis\n- **NCT02762344** and **NCT05982366** both include the incidence of pseudoaneurysm as part of their study outcomes but focus on transradial access rather than transpedal. These studies provide valuable data on vascular complications associated with radial access.\n- **NCT03645720** specifically investigates the incidence of pseudoaneurysm in arteriovenous grafts used for hemodialysis, offering direct data on this complication over a 6-month period.\n- **NCT00476944** and other related trials (e.g., **NCT01601873**) also mention pseudoaneurysm but in the context of different vascular access points or patient populations, such as those undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).\n\n### Study Characteristics\n- The studies vary in design, with some being observational registries (e.g., **NCT02762344**) and others being randomized controlled trials (e.g., **NCT00476944**).\n- Patient populations differ across studies, ranging from those undergoing routine cardiovascular procedures to patients receiving hemodialysis.\n- Interventions include different vascular access techniques and various procedural anticoagulation strategies.\n\n### Key Findings and Patterns\n- Pseudoaneurysm formation is a reported complication across various types of vascular access, not limited to transpedal routes.\n- There is a notable focus on the safety and efficacy of radial access in cardiovascular procedures, with pseudoaneurysm being one of several vascular complications monitored.\n- The incidence rates and definitions of pseudoaneurysm vary, indicating a need for standardized reporting in future studies.\n\n### Practical Implications\n- Patients considering participation in trials involving vascular access should be aware of the potential risk of pseudoaneurysm, among other complications.\n- Researchers should consider the variability in complication reporting and the need for standardized outcome measures when designing vascular access studies.\n- The current state of research highlights an ongoing interest in optimizing vascular access techniques to minimize complications.\n\n### Data Limitations\n- Specific pooled data on the incidence of pseudoaneurysm following transpedal arterial access is lacking in the provided trials.\n- Detailed long-term follow-up data on pseudoaneurysm outcomes post-procedure are limited.\n- Comparative data between different vascular access points (transpedal vs. transradial vs. others) are not extensively covered.\n\nThis analysis underscores the importance of continued research into vascular complications associated with different access points, with a particular need for focused studies on transpedal arterial access to better understand associated risks like pseudoaneurysm formation.",

    "answer": "### Executive Summary\nThe query regarding compartment syndrome rates following transpedal access procedures is specifically addressed in Clinical Trial 1 (NCT04361773). This study includes an evaluation of peripheral perfusion and clinical signs that may indicate compartment syndrome. No other trials in the provided data set directly report on compartment syndrome rates related to transpedal access procedures.\n\n### Detailed Analysis\n**Clinical Trial 1 (NCT04361773)** focuses on the effects of photobiomodulation on soft tissue traumatic injuries, with a secondary outcome measure assessing peripheral perfusion and clinical signs that could indicate compartment syndrome. This assessment is conducted through palpation of distal pulses, pain, and passive extension of fingers, among other clinical evaluations. The study's design includes baseline and ongoing assessments throughout the study completion, averaging 1 month.\n\n### Study Characteristics\n- **Clinical Trial 1 (NCT04361773)**: This is an interventional study examining the impact of photobiomodulation on wound healing and associated complications in lower limb injuries. The study includes detailed secondary outcomes related to pain, inflammation, lesion measurement, infection presence, and peripheral perfusion, which includes an assessment for compartment syndrome.\n- **Other Trials**: The remaining trials (NCT06919289, NCT06711731, NCT05172531, NCT03988231, NCT06333366) do not specifically address compartment syndrome or transpedal access procedures. These studies focus on various other medical assessments and interventions, such as perineural injections and intra-vesical pressure measurements during laparoscopic surgery.\n\n### Key Findings and Patterns\n- **Compartment Syndrome Assessment**: Only Clinical Trial 1 (NCT04361773) includes a direct assessment related to compartment syndrome as part of its evaluation of peripheral perfusion in trauma-related injuries.\n- **Methodological Approaches**: The studies vary significantly in their focus and methodologies, ranging from photobiomodulation therapy to perineural injections and pressure measurements in surgical settings.\n\n### Practical Implications\n- **For Patients**: Patients interested in the risks associated with compartment syndrome following specific procedures like transpedal access should consider the findings from NCT04361773 relevant. However, broader conclusions or comparisons require more targeted research.\n- **For Researchers**: There is a noticeable gap in studies explicitly focusing on compartment syndrome rates following transpedal access procedures. Future research could benefit from focusing on this area to provide clearer insights and guidelines.\n\n### Data Limitations\n- **Specificity of Data**: While NCT04361773 provides some insights into peripheral issues that might relate to compartment syndrome, it does not focus exclusively on transpedal access procedures, limiting the applicability of its findings to the user’s specific query.\n- **Lack of Comparative Studies**: There is a lack of studies directly comparing different approaches or interventions specifically aimed at reducing compartment syndrome rates post-transpedal access, indicating a potential area for further research.\n\nThis analysis highlights the need for more focused clinical trials addressing the specific outcomes related to compartment syndrome following transpedal access procedures to better inform clinical practices and patient care strategies.",

        "title": "Effect of Photobiomodulation on the Treatment of Soft Tissue Traumatic Injuries Primary Outcomes: Primary: Change of the wound healing process using the BATES-JENSEN scale - Evaluation of the healing process of soft tissue injuries in lower limbs associated with tibial fractures caused by high-energy trauma using the variation in the Bates Jensen Wound Assessment Tool scale score. The current version of BWAT contains 13 items that measure size, depth, borders, detachment, type and amount of necrotic tissue, type and amount of exudate, edema and hardening of the peripheral tissue, skin color around the wound, granulation tissue and epithelialization. The measurement scale is of the Likert type, with five points, where 1 indicates the best condition of the wound and 5, the worst condition. The total score is obtained with the sum of all items and can vary from 13 to 65 points, with the highest scores indicating the worst wound conditions. The items size, depth, edges and detachment should be scored as zero when the lesions are healed. The instrument contains two additional items - location and shape - that are not part of the total score. (Timeframe: Baseline and through study completion, an average of 1 month.) Secondary Outcomes: Secondary: Change in Pain Intensity Through VAS - Pain will be assessed by field researchers by applying the visual analogue pain scale (VAS). This scale is represented by a 10 cm line, with the phrases no pain and unbearable pain at its ends. (Timeframe: Baseline and through study completion, an average of 1 month.) Secondary: Consumption of painkillers - The type, dosage and frequency of analgesic consumption will be checked and recorded daily during the medical visit by the field team responsible for the daily medical visit. The results will be passed on to the main researcher for storage, tabulation and interpretation. (Timeframe: Baseline and through study completion, an average of 1 month.) Secondary: Change in serum evolution of inflammatory markers - For laboratory evaluation of the evolution of the inflammatory process and muscle damage, the following tests will be collected: C-reactive protein (CRP), Creatinophosphokinase (CPK), serum urea, creatinine, blood count and coagulogram. These exams will be collected at the time of admission, every three days and when the soft parts are resolved. (Timeframe: Baseline, every three days and through study completion, an average of 1 month.) Secondary: Change in Lesion Area Measurement - The wounds will be photographed along with a cut of graph paper using the camera of the iPhone 8 mobile device, to allow the calibration of the measurement application. The photos will be taken by the doctors who will visit the patient daily at the patient s bed and pass them on to the main researcher. The images will be stored and later evaluated with the aid of the Image J application, a public domain Java image processor and analyzer, developed by Wayne Rasband of the Research Services Branch, National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, Maryland. (Timeframe: Baseline and through study completion, an average of 1 month.) Secondary: Time needed for liberation for definitive surgery - Each lesion will be considered solved when it presents healthy granulation tissue, without necrosis or purulent secretion and is, therefore, suitable for primary closure, flap or graft closure or apt to choose healing by second intention. At this point, the protocol will be finalized and this data will be added to the study participant s medical record. (Timeframe: Baseline and through study completion, an average of 1 month.) Secondary: Presence of Infection - Field researchers will collect information regarding the patient s temperature, blood pressure and heart rate every 24 hours. In addition, the wound will be evaluated for the presence of secretion, necrosis, odor and color. If the wound shows signs of infection (purulent secretion, foul odor, areas of superficial or deep necrosis, accompanied or not by systemic signs such as fever, a fall in general condition, lack of appetite), surgical cleaning of the wound will be indicated, and at this moment, collections of samples for culture and photographs before and after surgical debridement will be carried out by field researchers. The patient will be excluded from the study. (Timeframe: Baseline and through study completion, an average of 1 month.) Secondary: Cost effectiveness of Photobiomodulation - The cost-effectiveness establishes whether or not a treatment should be implemented as a therapeutic measure, being calculated by the difference between the cost of two interventions proposed as treatment divided by the difference between its consequences. For the evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of photobiomodulation, the reduction in the score of the Bates Jensen scale will be considered as the outcome. (Timeframe: Baseline and through study completion, an average of 1 month.) Secondary: Change in Peripheral Perfusion through Clinical Evaluation - The peripheral perfusion of the affected limb will also be evaluated clinically by two doctors, through palpation of the distal pulses (pedicle and posterior tibial), pain and passive extension of the fingers (to clinically assess the occurrence of compartment syndrome) capillary filling time, limb, granulation of the wound, occurrence of superficial or deep necrosis. In case of vascular involvement of the limb, joint assessment with the vascular surgery service will be requested and the case will be excluded from the study.

The main question it aims to answer is: whether is TRA not inferior to TFA In the experimental group, the transradial access (TRA) was used, which was to puncture the radial artery and insert a radial sheath to establish a surgical pathway for embolization of the aneurysm; In the control group, transfemoral access (TFA) was used to embolize the aneurysms, which was to puncture the femoral artery and insert the femoral sheath to establish a surgical pathway for embolizing the aneurysms.The two groups of patients received an oral loading dose of aspirin (300mg) plus clopidogrel (300mg) on the day of surgery, while patients who were unable to take orally were given nasal feeding. During the operation, systemic heparinization was performed with a starting dose of 75U/kg intravenous injection, and the injection was halved every 1h until 1000U.

However, they offer detailed descriptions of the procedural techniques involved in each access method, which can indirectly inform about potential differences in procedural complexity and duration.\n\n### Detailed Analysis\n- **NCT05436405** focuses on transpedal access for endovascular revascularization in complex infra-popliteal lesions. It describes the use of a 21-gauge needle or a micropuncture access set, with fluoroscopy or road mapping to facilitate access.\n- **NCT01071460** discusses retrograde common femoral cross-over access for stenting, indicating a standard procedural approach that might be comparable in duration to other femoral access interventions but does not specify exact times.\n\n### Study Characteristics\n- **Study Designs**: Both NCT05436405 and NCT01071460 are interventional with a single-group allocation. NCT05436405 is non-randomized, focusing on treatment, while NCT01071460 does not specify its randomization status.\n- **Patient Populations**: Both studies involve patients with critical limb ischemia or peripheral artery disease requiring revascularization or stenting.\n- **Intervention Details**: NCT05436405 uses ultrasound and fluoroscopy-guided transpedal access. NCT01071460 employs a more traditional stenting technique via femoral access.\n\n### Key Findings and Patterns\n- **Methodological Variations**: Transpedal access (NCT05436405) might be associated with more specialized techniques and potentially longer procedure times due to the precision required in accessing smaller vessels. Traditional femoral access (NCT01071460) is described as using routine stenting protocols, which might suggest a more streamlined procedure.\n- **Technological Utilization**: Enhanced imaging techniques such as fluoroscopy and ultrasound play crucial roles in modern vascular interventions, potentially influencing the efficiency and safety of these procedures.\n\n### Practical Implications\n- **For Patients**: Patients seeking less invasive options or those with previous unsuccessful femoral interventions might consider trials like NCT05436405 exploring alternative access sites.\n- **For Researchers**: Understanding the nuances in procedural times and outcomes between different vascular access techniques can guide future studies and innovations in peripheral vascular intervention technologies.\n\n### Data Limitations\n- The specific procedure times for each method were not detailed in the trial records, which limits direct comparisons of efficiency between transpedal and retrograde femoral access.\n- Additional data on patient recovery times and long-term outcomes post-intervention would be beneficial for a more comprehensive analysis.\n\nIn summary, while direct data on procedure times are lacking, the available information suggests that transpedal access involves specialized techniques that may affect its duration compared to traditional femoral access. Further research explicitly measuring these times would be valuable for clinical practice.",

PROCEDURE - Retrograde Aortic Approach Catheter Ablation Procedure: The retrograde aortic approach entails obtaining femoral arterial access and leaving a sheath in the femoral artery. Under fluoroscopy, an ablation catheter is then advanced up the ascending aorta where the catheter tip is curved using an internal mechanism controlled on the handle of the catheter to form a large loop (to prevent the tip from traveling down a coronary artery and causing trauma such as a dissection); the curved loop is advanced around the aortic arch and down the ascending aorta. To cross the aortic valve with this loop, the catheter is typically torqued in various directions until it falls through the aortic valve and into the left ventricle.

    "answer": "### Executive Summary\nThe clinical trial data from NCT01884701 provides insights into the use of the ENABLER-P Catheter System for crossing chronic total occlusions (CTOs) in the femoropopliteal artery. The primary outcome measures include the advancement of the guidewire into or through the CTO and subsequent achievement of distal vessel guidewire position. However, specific crossing rates for transpedal access in chronic total occlusions are not detailed in the available data.\n\n### Detailed Analysis\n**NCT01884701** focuses on evaluating the ENABLER-P Catheter System's efficacy in crossing CTOs during endovascular interventions for femoral-popliteal occlusive disease. The primary outcomes are safety endpoints (major adverse events, perforations, embolization, dissections) and procedural success in guidewire advancement through CTOs. The study was withdrawn before completion, limiting the availability of results on crossing rates or long-term outcomes.\n\n**NCT05971394** investigates the IBS Titan Sirolimus-eluting Iron Bioresorbable Peripheral Scaffold System, primarily measuring efficacy failure and major adverse events. While it addresses peripheral occlusions, it does not specifically focus on transpedal access or provide crossing rates for CTOs.\n\n### Study Characteristics\n- **NCT01884701**: An interventional, single-arm, non-randomized, multi-center study in Phase 3, focusing on femoropopliteal occlusive disease using the ENABLER-P Catheter System.\n- **NCT05971394**: A study on a bioresorbable scaffold system targeting infrapopliteal lesions, assessing various efficacy and safety outcomes over multiple timeframes.\n\n### Key Findings and Patterns\n- Both studies target peripheral arterial occlusions but utilize different devices and approaches.\n- NCT01884701 specifically aims to evaluate a device's ability to cross CTOs but was withdrawn, indicating potential challenges or changes in research focus.\n- NCT05971394 provides broader insights into peripheral artery disease treatments but does not focus on transpedal access or specific crossing rates.\n\n### Practical Implications\nFor patients seeking treatment for femoropopliteal occlusive disease, understanding the specific devices and their intended outcomes is crucial. Researchers should note the withdrawal of NCT01884701 and consider investigating factors that might influence such outcomes in future studies.\n\n### Data Limitations\n- The withdrawal of NCT01884701 limits comprehensive understanding and applicability of the ENABLER-P Catheter System's effectiveness in real-world settings.\n- Specific crossing rates for transpedal access in CTOs are not detailed, indicating a gap in available data that could be crucial for clinical decision-making and further research.\n\nFurther research is needed to provide more definitive data on the success rates and safety of transpedal access methods in treating chronic total occlusions, particularly in the femoropopliteal segment.",
