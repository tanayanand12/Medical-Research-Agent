Prior trials have been limited by small sample sizes, single-center designs, and often a lack of sham controls. OBJECTIVE: To examine the safety and efficacy of tPCS in improving social functioning and sleep disorders in children with ASD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This multicenter, double-blind, 2-armed, sham-controlled randomized clinical trial, conducted from May 1, 2022, through November 30, 2023, assessed children aged 3 to 14 years with ASD at 8 medical centers in China. INTERVENTIONS: Participants underwent daily 20-minute sessions of active tPCS (0.7 mA) or sham tPCS (brief 0.7 mA ramp-up and ramp-down) for 20 sessions over 4 weeks with anode over the right cerebellar hemisphere and cathode over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (12.56-cm2-circular, 4-cm-diameter circular electrodes). Each day after tPCS, all participants received 1 hour of standard therapy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Social functioning was assessed using the Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included the Autism Behavior Checklist and the Childhood Sleep Habits Questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 312 participants (155 in the active group and 157 in the sham group; 248 [79.5%] boys; mean [SD] age, 5.1 [1.6] years; 276 [88.5%] aged 3-6 years and 36 [11.5%] aged 7-14 years) completed the trial. After 20 sessions, the mean Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist total score improved by 4.13 points (5.8%) in the sham tPCS group and 7.17 points (10.7%) in the active tPCS group. Analysis of covariance showed significantly greater improvement in the active tPCS group (difference, -3.50; 95% CI, -5.56 to -1.43; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Both treatments were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial of prefrontal-cerebellar tPCS in children aged 3 to 14 years with ASD, 20 sessions over 4 weeks improved social functioning and sleep. These findings suggest that tPCS may serve as a viable nonpharmacologic alternative for ASD. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry Identifier: ChiCTR2200059118.",

Among approximately 2000 annual deaths related to child maltreatment, more than 40% resulted from physical abuse, and half of those children were younger than 1 year. Many of these young children had unidentified abusive injuries before the fatal event. OBJECTIVE: To determine the accuracy of clinical and radiologic findings for identifying physical abuse among children who have sustained an injury. DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION: MEDLINE, PubMed Central, and Embase were searched for articles published from 1970 to September 2024. Three authors identified studies describing clinical and radiologic characteristics in children and adolescents undergoing assessment for physical abuse. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: The number of children with and without each clinical or radiologic finding, and the presence or absence of physical abuse, which had been determined by expert panels, predefined criteria, or standardized scales that quantify the level of concern for abuse, were recorded. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios (LRs) of each finding for the presence of physical abuse were calculated and the range or calculated summary measures were reported when the finding was evaluated in more than 1 study. RESULTS: Of 7378 unique articles, 18 studies met inclusion criteria. The prevalence of physical abuse in these 18 studies ranged from 5% to 79%. Studies that were focused on skin findings in children evaluated for trauma showed that the presence of oral injury such as a torn frenulum (positive LR, 6.6 [95% CI, 3.2-14.0]), bruising on the buttocks (positive LR range, 15-83) or neck (positive LR range, 2.2-84), patterned bruises (positive LR range, 2.0-66), and subconjunctival hemorrhage (positive LR range, 5.4-130) were associated with increased likelihood of physical abuse. In studies of hospitalized children with head injury, the presence of retinal hemorrhages (positive LR, 11.0 [95% CI, 4.0-32.0]), seizures (positive LR, 3.9 [95% CI, 2.4-6.5]), hypoxic ischemic injury (positive LR, 3.4 [95% CI, 1.8-6.4]), or a subdural hematoma (positive LR, 3.2 [95% CI, 2.6-3.8]) increased the likelihood of physical abuse. In studies examining children who underwent skeletal surveys, a single fracture (positive LR, 5.9 [95% CI, 2.9-12.0]) or multiple fractures (positive LR, 3.8 [95% CI, 2.4-6.0]) increased the likelihood of physical abuse. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: A detailed physical examination that reveals oral injury, bruises on the buttocks or neck, patterned bruises, and subconjunctival hemorrhage in young children should alert clinicians to the possibility of physical abuse. Findings on neuroimaging and ophthalmologic evaluation in infants and young children with head trauma can help clinicians determine the likelihood of physical abuse.",

METHODS: This prospective cohort study included 268,634 UK Biobank study participants with high, moderate, or low cardiovascular health based on LE8 scores. High and low cardiovascular health corresponded to the lowest and highest cardiovascular disease risks, respectively. The hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for AMD were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models. The dose-response relationships were evaluated using restricted cubic spline analysis. Stratified analyses using the AMD-polygenic risk score categories were used to assess potential modification. A composite variable combined LE8 and AMD-polygenic risk to examine their joint effects. RESULTS: Over an average of 13.76 years, 5253 participants developed AMD. Compared with the lowest cardiovascular health, moderate and high cardiovascular health had adjusted HRs of 0.86 (95% CI, 0.76, 0.97) and 0.79 (0.69, 0.91), respectively. Each standard deviation increase in the LE8 score corresponded to an HR of 0.93 (0.91, 0.96). The LE8 behavior (HR = 0.94 [0.91, 0.96]) and biological (HR = 0.97 [0.95, 1.00]) subscale scores were inversely associated with AMD, whereas the blood lipids component was positively associated (HR = 1.07 [1.04, 1.10]). The AMD-polygenic risk and LE8 scores showed no significant interaction. The HR for having low AMD-polygenic risk and high cardiovascular health relative to having high AMD-polygenic risk and low cardiovascular health was 0.47 (0.37, 0.58).

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Intracerebral Hemorrhage Acutely Decreasing Arterial Pressure Trial 2 (ICHADAPT-2) was a multicenter, randomized, open-label, blinded-end point trial. Between November 2012 and August 2022, patients with ICH presenting within 6 hours of onset were randomized to a systolic BP (SBP) target of less than 140 mm Hg or less than 180 mm Hg. The trial was conducted at 3 comprehensive stroke centers in Canada and Australia, including 1 telestroke referral hub and 1 community stroke hospital.

        "paper_abstract": "PURPOSE: ChatGPT, a comprehensive language processing model, provides the opportunity for supportive and professional interactions with patients. However, its use to address patients' frequently asked questions (FAQs) and the readability of the text generated by ChatGPT remain unexplored, particularly in geriatrics. We identified the FAQs about common geriatric syndromes and assessed the accuracy and readability of the responses provided by ChatGPT. METHODS: Two geriatricians with extensive knowledge and experience in geriatric syndromes independently reviewed the 28 responses provided by ChatGPT. The accuracy of the responses generated by ChatGPT was categorized on a rating scale from 0 (harmful) to 4 (excellent) based on current guidelines and approaches. The readability of the text generated by ChatGPT was assessed by administering two tests: the Flesch-Kincaid Reading Ease (FKRE) and the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL). RESULTS: ChatGPT-generated responses with an overall mean accuracy score of 88% (3.52/4). Responses generated for sarcopenia diagnosis and depression treatment in older adults had the lowest accuracy scores (2.0 and 2.5, respectively). The mean FKRE score of the texts was 25.2, while the mean FKGL score was 14.5. CONCLUSION: The accuracy scores of the responses generated by ChatGPT were high in most common geriatric syndromes except for sarcopenia diagnosis and depression treatment. Moreover, the text generated by ChatGPT was very difficult to read and best understood by college graduates. ChatGPT may reduce the uncertainty many patients face. Nevertheless, it remains advisable to consult with subject matter experts when undertaking consequential decision-making.",
