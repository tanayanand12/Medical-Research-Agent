ALL INSPECTIONS ARE CONDUCTED ON 100% OF UNITS EXPECT FOR PRODUCT VERIFICATION (PV) TESTING. PER PROCEDURE, DURING THE CRIMP BALLOON TRIMMING AND FINAL INSPECTION, THE CRIMP BALLOON FEATURES ARE 100% DIMENSIONALLY INSPECTED FOR DEFECTS. PER PROCEDURE, THE INFLATION BALLOON UNDERGOES 100% BALLOON DIMENSIONAL AND VISUAL INSPECTION FOR ANY DEFECTS. DURING FINAL INSPECTION, THE ENTIRE DEVICE IS INSPECTED DISTAL TO PROXIMAL FOR DEVICE DAMAGE. DURING PV TESTING, THE UNITS ARE TESTED ON A SAMPLING BASIS. THE DELIVERY SYSTEM IS VISUALLY INSPECTED AND RETRIEVAL FORCE SYSTEM THROUGH SHEATH IS PERFORMED. ALL TESTED UNITS PASSED PV TESTING. THESE INSPECTIONS DURING THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS SUPPORT THAT IT IS UNLIKELY THAT A DEFECT IN MANUFACTURING CONTRIBUTED TO THE COMPLAINT EVENT. A DEVICE HISTORY RECORD (DHR) REVIEW WAS PERFORMED AND DID NOT REVEAL ANY MANUFACTURING NON-CONFORMANCE THAT WOULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE REPORTED EVENT. A LOT HISTORY WAS PERFORMED AND REVEALED NO OTHER SIMILAR COMPLAINTS FOR THE REPORTED EVENT. A REVIEW OF COMPLAINT HISTORY REVEALED THAT THE OCCURRENCE RATE DID NO EXCEED THE APRIL 2020 CONTROL LIMIT FOR THE TREND CATEGORY. THE COMMANDER IFU, DEVICE PREPARATION MANUAL, AND PROCEDURAL TRAINING MANUAL WERE REVIEWED FOR GUIDANCE INVOLVING DELIVERY SYSTEM USAGE. THE PROCEDURAL TRAINING MANUAL PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON DELIVERY SYSTEM REMOVAL. COMPLETELY UNFLEX THE DELIVERY SYSTEM, ENSURE FLEX TIP IS STILL OVER THE TRIPLE MARKER, ENSURE BALLOON LOCK IS LOCKED, ENSURE THE BALLOON IS COMPLETELY DEFLATED, PULL THE ENTIRE DELIVERY SYSTEM THROUGH THE SHEATH AND MAINTAIN GUIDEWIRE POSITION IN THE AORTA. NOTE THAT PATIENT INJURY COULD OCCUR IF THE DELIVERY SYSTEM IS NOT COMPLETELY UNFLEXED PRIOR TO REMOVAL. NO IFU OR TRAINING DEFICIENCIES WERE IDENTIFIED. PER THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE (IFU), CARDIOVASCULAR INJURIES, INCLUDING PERFORATION OR DISSECTION OF VESSELS, VENTRICLE, MYOCARDIUM OR VALVULAR STRUCTURES, ARE POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH STANDARD CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION, BALLOON VALVULOPLASTY AND THE TRANSCATHETER AORTIC VALVE REPLACEMENT (TAVR) PROCEDURE. THERE ARE SEVERAL POTENTIAL ETIOLOGIES FOR VENTRICULAR PERFORATION DURING A TAVR PROCEDURE, INCLUDING PERFORATION BY THE GUIDEWIRE, THE DELIVERY SYSTEM, OR THE TRANSVENOUS PACER (TVP) LEAD. PHYSICIANS ARE EXTENSIVELY TRAINED BY EDWARDS BEFORE THEY ARE QUALIFIED TO USE THE SAPIEN TRANSCATHETER HEART VALVE (THV). TRAINING INCLUDES PROPER GUIDEWIRE POSITIONING, FIXATION OF THE TVP TO PREVENT VENTRICLE PERFORATION, AND CAREFUL MANIPULATION OF DEVICES. PER THE PROCEDURE DIDACTIC, PATIENTS WITH SMALL VENTRICLES ARE AT PARTICULARLY HIGH RISK FOR VENTRICULAR PERFORATION THE COMPLAINT FOR WAS UNABLE TO BE CONFIRMED AS NO RELEVANT PROCEDURAL IMAGERY/CINE WAS NOT PROVIDED. DUE TO UNAVAILABILITY OF DEVICE, ENGINEERING WAS UNABLE TO PERFORM ANY VISUAL, FUNCTIONAL, OR DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS. AS A RESULT, THE PRESENCE OF A MANUFACTURING NON-CONFORMANCE WAS UNABLE TO BE CONFIRMED. REVIEW OF DHR AND LOT HISTORY SHOWED NO INDICATION A MANUFACTURING NON-CONFORMANCE CONTRIBUTED TO THE COMPLAINT EVENT. A REVIEW OF MANUFACTURING MITIGATIONS SUPPORTS THAT THE DELIVERY SYSTEM HAS PROPER INSPECTIONS IN PLACE TO DETECT ISSUES RELATED TO THE COMPLAINT EVENT. A REVIEW OF IFU/TRAINING MATERIALS REVEALED NO DEFICIENCIES. \u00bfPER MEDICAL OPINION, INSERTION AND ADVANCEMENT OF DELIVERY SYSTEM WAS DIFFICULT DUE TO NARROW ACCESS VESSEL AND KYPHOSIS.\u00bf REVIEW OF CASE NOTES STATE THAT THE PATIENT HAD A MINIMUM LUMINAL DIAMETER (MLD) OF 4.4 MM AND MODERATELY CALCIFIED AND TORTUOUS ACCESS VESSEL. THE SMALL VESSEL DIAMETER (<5.0MM PER IFU FOR 14F) IN ADDITION TO THE PRESENCE OF TORTUOSITY CAN CREATE A RESTRICTED AND CHALLENGING PATHWAY DURING DEVICE INSERTION AND/OR RETRIEVAL. IN ADDITION, THE VESSEL WAS REPORTED TO HAVE ECCENTRIC CALCIUM. DURING WITHDRAWAL OF THE DS, THE DS BALLOON WAS LIKELY CAUGHT ON THE CALCIUM NODULES CAUSING THE REPORTED DIFFICULTY IN RETRIEVING THE DELIVERY SYSTEM. IN THIS CASE, AVAILABLE INFORMATION SUGGESTS THAT PATIENT FACTORS (SMALL VESSEL DIAMETER/CALCIFICATION/TORTUOSITY) CONTRIBUTED TO THE REPORTED EVENT. IN ADDITION, PER REPORT, THE VENTRICULAR PERFORATION WAS LIKELY CAUSED BY THE GUIDE WIRE DURING DELIVERY SYSTEM WITHDRAWAL. NO MANUFACTURING NON-CONFORMANCE WERE IDENTIFIED DURING THE EVALUATION. NO LABELING/TRAINING INADEQUACIES WERE IDENTIFIED.

COOK BECAME AWARE OF THIS EVENT ON (B)(6) 2020 UPON BEING NOTIFIED OF THE JOURNAL ARTICLE FROM HOSPITAL NORD. THE PATIENT REPORTEDLY EXPERIENCED INCREASING DESATURATION, BRADYCARDIA, AND LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS SEVEN DAYS AFTER THE DEVICE WAS IMPLANTED, AND LATER REQUIRED MECHANICAL VENTILATION. THE PATIENT LATER RECOVERED, AND AN MRI SCAN COMPLETED SIX WEEKS LATER SHOWED FAVORABLE RESULTS. A REVIEW OF DOCUMENTATION INCLUDING THE COMPLAINT HISTORY, DEVICE HISTORY RECORD, INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE (IFU), MANUFACTURING INSTRUCTIONS AND QUALITY CONTROL OF THE DEVICE WAS CONDUCTED DURING THE INVESTIGATION. THE COMPLAINT DEVICE WAS NOT RETURNED FOR EVALUATION; THEREFORE, NO PHYSICAL EXAMINATIONS COULD BE CONDUCTED. HOWEVER, A DOCUMENT-BASED INVESTIGATION EVALUATION WAS PERFORMED. A REVIEW OF THE DEVICE MASTER RECORD (DMR) FOUND THAT SUFFICIENT CONTROLS ARE IN PLACE TO DETECT POTENTIALLY RELATED FAILURE MODES PRIOR TO RELEASE. A REVIEW OF THE DESIGN HISTORY FILE (DHF) SHOWED THAT THE RISKS OF THIS DEVICE ARE ACCEPTABLE WHEN WEIGHED AGAINST THE BENEFITS. A REVIEW OF THE DEVICE HISTORY RECORD (DHR) COULD NOT BE CONDUCTED DUE TO LACK OF LOT INFORMATION FROM THE JOURNAL ARTICLE AND CUSTOMER FACILITY. A REVIEW OF THE SALES RECORDS TO THE USER FACILITY OVER THREE YEARS PRIOR TO THE JOURNAL PUBLICATION DATE (01JAN2016 TO 06FEB2020) SHOWED 13 POTENTIAL LOT NUMBERS. NO RELATED NONCONFORMANCES WERE FOUND FOR THOSE 13 LOTS. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THERE WERE NO ADDITIONAL COMPLAINTS REPORTED FOR ANY OF THESE LOT NUMBERS. SINCE THERE ARE NO RELATED NONCONFORMANCES OR COMPLAINTS FROM THE 13 POTENTIAL LOTS, THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT NONCONFORMING PRODUCT EXISTS IN HOUSE OR IN THE FIELD. THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE (IFU), PROVIDES THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION TO THE USER RELATED TO THE REPORTED FAILURE MODE PRECAUTIONS: THIS PRODUCT IS INTENDED FOR USE BY PHYSICIANS TRAINED AND EXPERIENCED IN THE TREATMENT OF A PNEUMOTHORAX. STANDARD TECHNIQUES FOR PLACEMENT OF PNEUMOTHORAX CATHETERS SHOULD BE EMPLOYED. ENSURE STOPCOCK IS IN THE ON POSITION TO THE VALVE TO PREVENT ASPIRATION OF AIR. LUNG PUNCTURE MAY RESULT IN AN AIR EMBOLUS, WHICH COULD LEAD TO ISCHEMIA OR INFARCTION OF MAJOR ORGANS, INCLUDING THE BRAIN OR CARDIAC SYSTEM. INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE 8. REMOVE THE OBTURATOR AND CONFIRM PLACEMENT BY VALVE MOVEMENT AND FLUOROSCOPIC OR ROENTGENOGRAPHIC VERIFICATION. ALL CONNECTIONS MUST BE SECURE AND AIRTIGHT. PERFORM INSPECTIONS OF THE CATHETER AND CONNECTIONS REGULARLY. BASED ON THE INFORMATION PROVIDED, NO RETURNED PRODUCT AND THE RESULTS OF OUR INVESTIGATION, IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT THE PROCEDURAL TECHNIQUE POTENTIALLY CONTRIBUTED TO THE EVENT. IT IS UNCLEAR HOW A CEREBRAL AIR EMBOLISM FORMED FROM THE PROCEDURE. THE JOURNAL AUTHORS PROPOSE SOME SCENARIOS THAT MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE EVENT, SUCH AS VASCULAR DAMAGE. AIR MAY HAVE ENTERED THE BLOODSTREAM IF ANY PULMONARY BLOOD VESSELS WERE PUNCTURED/DAMAGED BY THE INTRODUCER NEEDLE, BUT THIS CANNOT BE CONFIRMED WITHOUT ADDITIONAL IMAGING/VISUALIZATION. THE APPROPRIATE PERSONNEL HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED. PER THE QUALITY ENGINEERING RISK ASSESSMENT NO FURTHER ACTION IS REQUIRED. WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR FOR SIMILAR COMPLAINTS.

PER THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE (IFU), BALLOON RUPTURE IS A POTENTIAL RISK OF THE TAVR PROCEDURE. TRANSCATHETER DELIVERY BALLOON BURST COMPLAINTS HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY INVESTIGATED BY EDWARDS AND DOCUMENTED IN A CLINICAL TECHNICAL SUMMARY WRITTEN BY EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES. A DETAILED ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT IT IS VERY UNLIKELY THAT A PRODUCT DEFECT CONTRIBUTES TO THIS TYPE OF EVENT. THERE ARE EXTENSIVE MANUFACTURING INSPECTIONS IN PLACE TO PREVENT THIS TYPE OF MALFUNCTION (VISUAL AND DIMENSIONAL INSPECTIONS, LEAK TESTING, AND FUNCTIONAL BALLOON BURST TESTING PERFORMED TO EVERY MANUFACTURED LOT). THE THV DELIVERY SYSTEM BALLOONS ARE SUBJECT TO INCREASED RISK OF BURST DUE TO CONTACT WITH A HIGHLY CALCIFIED ANNULUS. ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT THESE TYPES OF RUPTURES ARE TYPICALLY CAUSED BY PUNCTURE FROM CALCIUM ON THE NATIVE AORTIC VALVE WHEN THE INFLATED DELIVERY SYSTEM BALLOON COMES IN CONTACT WITH THE NATIVE ANNULAR CALCIFICATION AT FULL INFLATION/DEPLOYMENT. THE COMMANDER DELIVERY SYSTEM WAS NOT RETURNED TO EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES FOR EVALUATION. WITHOUT THE DEVICE, VISUAL INSPECTION, FUNCTIONAL TESTING AND DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS COULD NOT BE PERFORMED. REVIEW OF THE CASE IMAGERY AND DEVICE PHOTOGRAPHS INCLUDED IN THE ARTICLE REVEALED THE FLEX TIP WAS NOT PULLED BACK ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE TRIPLE MARKERS DURING THE DEPLOYMENT OF THE VALVE. POTENTIAL CALCIFICATION WAS PRESENT IN THE VALVE DEPLOYMENT REGION. DURING THE ATTEMPT TO REMOVE THE BALLOON, IT BECAME STRANDED AT THE INFRARRENAL AORTA. VESSEL DISSECTION OCCURRED DURING THE ATTEMPTS TO RETRIEVE THE DELIVERY SYSTEM. FROM THE PROVIDED PHOTOGRAPHS, THE OCCURRENCE OF BALLOON BURST WAS NOT ABLE TO BE CONFIRMED (NO IMAGE AVAILABLE OF FAILURE MODE). THE OCCURRENCE OF RETRIEVAL DIFFICULTY CAN BE CONFIRMED BASED ON SURGICAL INTERVENTION TO RETRIEVE DEVICE AND TREAT DISSECTION. DEVICE HISTORY REVIEW (DHR) REVIEW WAS NOT ABLE TO BE PERFORMED DUE TO THE UNAVAILABILITY OF THE DEVICE LOT NUMBER. THE LOT HISTORY REVIEW WAS NOT ABLE TO BE PERFORMED DUE TO THE UNAVAILABILITY OF THE DEVICE LOT NUMBER. COMPLAINT HISTORY REVIEW REVEALED THE OCCURRENCE RATE DID NOT EXCEED THE APRIL 2020 CONTROL LIMITS FOR APPLICABLE TREND CATEGORIES. PER THE IFU AND TRAINING MANUALS, IF A BALLOON BURST OCCURS, ATTEMPT TO VISUALIZE LOCATION OF TEAR EITHER IN TEE OR VIA ANGIO THROUGH THE PIGTAIL OR CATHETER/DELIVERY SYSTEM. WHEN REMOVING, ENSURE THE CATHETER/DELIVERY SYSTEM AND WIRE ARE COAXIAL WITH THE SHEATH TIP. WATCH UNDER FLUORO WITH EVERY MOVEMENT. BE PATIENT AND PULL GENTLY ESPECIALLY NEAR TEAR AND BALLOON SHOULDER TRANSITIONS. DO NOT FORCE IF RESISTANCE IS MET NEAR OR AT THE SHEATH TIP. FORCE COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL TEARING OF THE BALLOON MATERIAL AND THE BALLOON MATERIAL OR TIP COMING OFF. IF GETTING RESISTANCE, GOING IN WITH A SNARE AND COMPRESSING THE DISTAL END OF THE TORN BALLOON TO PREVENT IT FROM \u00bfUMBRELLA-ING\u00bf AT THE TIP OF THE SHEATH COULD HELP. UNDERSTANDING WHERE THE TEAR IS MAY HELP IN THIS CASE. IF SUCCESSFUL IN PULLING THE ENTIRE BALLOON INTO THE TIP OF THE SHEATH, WITHDRAW THE CATHETER/DELIVERY SYSTEM AND SHEATH AS A SINGLE UNIT COMPLETELY FROM THE ARTERIOTOMY WHILE MAINTAINING GUIDEWIRE POSITION. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO PULL JUST THE CATHETER/DELIVERY SYSTEM THROUGH THE SHEATH. IF YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO PULL THE ENTIRE BALLOON INTO THE SHEATH, DO NOT ATTEMPT TO REMOVE THE EXPOSED BALLOON THROUGH THE VASCULATURE. RISK OF MAJOR COMPLICATION IS TOO HIGH. CONVERT TO SURGERY IMMEDIATELY. IT SHOULD BE SURGICALLY REMOVED. SURGEON SHOULD BE IN A POSITION TO BE ABLE TO EVALUATE THE SITUATION BEFORE A REAL BLEEDING EMERGENCY OCCURS. NO IFU/TRAINING MANUAL DEFICIENCIES WERE FOUND. DURING THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS, THE DELIVERY SYSTEM BALLOON COMPONENTS UNDERGO MULTIPLE VISUAL INSPECTIONS AND TESTING THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS. THE DELIVERY SYSTEM UNDERGOES 100% LEAK TESTING FOLLOWED BY 100% POST LEAK VISUAL INSPECTION. DURING FINAL TESTING, 100% DISTAL TO PROXIMAL VISUAL INSPECTION IS PERFORMED BY MANUFACTURING AND QUALITY. ADDITIONALLY, FUNCTIONAL PRODUCT VERIFICATION (PV) TESTING IS PERFORMED ON A SAMPLING BASIS. THESE INSPECTIONS DURING THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS SUPPORT THAT IT IS UNLIKELY A MANUFACTURING NON-CONFORMANCE CONTRIBUTED TO THE REPORTED COMPLAINT. IN THIS CASE, THE BALLOON BURST COMPLAINT WAS NOT ABLE TO BE CONFIRMED DUE TO THE UNAVAILABILITY OF THE DEVICE. IMAGERY SUGGESTS CALCIFICATION PRESENT IN THE ANNULUS. AS IDENTIFIED IN CLINICAL TECHNICAL SUMMARY WRITTEN BY EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES, THE PRESENCE OF ANY LEVEL OF CALCIFICATION IN THE ANNULUS DURING BALLOON DEPLOYMENT MAY LEAD TO BALLOON BURST THROUGH MECHANISMS SUCH AS PUNCTURE, LOCAL OVER STRETCHING, OPEN CELL IMPINGEMENT, AND STRESS CONCENTRATION. ADDITIONALLY, CASE IMAGERY SHOWS THE FLEX TIP IS NOT POSITIONED OVER THE TRIPLE MARKERS DURING DEPLOYMENT. AS PER IFU \u00bfPULL BACK FLEX CATHETER SO IT IS OFF THE BALLOON DURING DEPLOYMENT. POSITIONING FLEX TIP ON THE TRIPLE MARKER PRIOR TO THV DEPLOYMENT WILL HELP MAINTAIN STABILITY WHILE ENSURING UNOBSTRUCTED INFLATION DURING DEPLOYMENT.\u00bf NOT PULLING THE FLEX TIP BACK TO THE TRIPLE MARKERS CAN OBSTRUCT THE INFLATION OF THE BALLOON, POTENTIALLY SUBJECTING THE COMPONENT TO HIGHER THAN INTENDED INFLATION PRESSURES AND CONTRIBUTE TO AN INCREASED RISK OF BURST. THE COMPLAINT FOR WITHDRAWAL DIFFICULTY WAS ABLE TO BE CONFIRMED BASED ON THE PROVIDED IMAGERY. NO MANUFACTURING NON-CONFORMANCE WAS NOT IDENTIFIED DURING THE EVALUATION. AS MENTIONED IN THE DESCRIPTION \u00bfWHILE WE ATTEMPTED TO REMOVE THE BALLOON, IT BECAME STRANDED AT THE INFRARRENAL AORTA\u00bf. DUE TO THE BALLOON BURST, THE BALLOON LIKELY HAD AN ALTERED PROFILE. THIS ALTERED PROFILE MAY HAVE GOTTEN CAUGHT AT THE SHEATH TIP DURING RETRIEVAL, CONTRIBUTING TO THE COMPLAINT EVENT.

ACCORDING TO THE ACCOUNT, THE LOW FLOWS WERE SECONDARY TO HYPERTENSION. A DIRECT CORRELATION BETWEEN HEARTMATE 3 LVAS, SERIAL NUMBER (B)(6), AND REPORTED EVENTS COULD NOT CONCLUSIVELY BE DETERMINED. THE ACCOUNT SUBMITTED A LOG FILE FOR REVIEW. THE SYSTEM CONTROLLER EVENT LOG FILE CONTAINS DATA FROM (B)(6) 2020 AT 16:12:48 THROUGH (B)(6) 2020 AT 10:33:43. LOW FLOW EVENTS WERE CAPTURED THROUGHOUT THE LOG FILE FROM (B)(6) 2020 AT 16:13:00 THROUGH (B)(6) 2020 AT 9:27:43. PER DESIGN, WHEN THE FLOW VALUE IS CALCULATED AT LESS THAN 2.5 LPM, A LOW FLOW STATUS IS POSTED TO THE LOG FILE. A 10-SECOND DELAY IS IMPOSED BETWEEN THE DETECTION OF THE LOW FLOW STATUS AND THE ACTIVATION OF THE ASSOCIATED AUDIO AND VISUAL INDICATORS ON THE SYSTEM CONTROLLER. SOME OF THE EVENTS LASTED OVER 10 SECONDS, AND LOW FLOW ALARMS WERE FLAGGED. TRANSIENT PI EVENTS WERE OBSERVED THROUGHOUT THE LOG FILE, RESULTING IN MOMENTARY DECREASES IN SPEED PER DESIGN. THE PUMP APPEARED TO FUNCTION AS INTENDED. THE ACCOUNT COMMUNICATED THAT THE PATIENT WAS ADMITTED ON (B)(6) 2020 TO HOSPITAL DUE TO CARDIAC ARREST. EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES AUTHORITY (EMSA) REPORTED THAT THE PATIENT RECEIVED 4 ROUNDS OF EPINEPHRINE; HOWEVER, IT WAS AROUND 40 MINUTES BEFORE THEY SAW AN ORGANIZED RHYTHM ON THE MONITOR. ON (B)(6) 2020, THE NURSE REPORTED LOW FLOWS AND THE PATIENT'S BLOOD PRESSURE WAS AT 180'S/120'S. THE LOW FLOWS WERE DETERMINED TO BE BLOOD PRESSURE RELATED AND IT WAS RECOMMENDED THEY KEEP HIS MEAN ARTERIAL PRESSURE AT 70-90. MEDICATION WAS ORDERED AND HYPOTHERMIA PROTOCOL WAS CONTINUED. ACCORDING TO THE ACCOUNT, THE PATIENT REMAINED HYPERTENSIVE AFTER MEDICATION WAS ADMINISTERED AND SEDATION WAS INCREASED, AND NEW MEDICATION ORDERS WERE THEN GIVEN. THE PATIENT EXPIRED ON (B)(6) 2020 DUE TO ANOXIC BRAIN INJURY. THE HEARTMATE 3 LVAD, SERIAL NUMBER (B)(6), WAS NOT RETURNED FOR ANALYSIS. THE HM3 LVAS IFU LISTS HYPERTENSION AS AN ADVERSE EVENT THAT MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF THE HEARTMATE 3 LEFT VENTRICULAR ASSIST SYSTEM. THE IFU EXPLAINS THAT THE LOW FLOW HAZARD ALARM WILL BE TRIGGERED WHEN PUMP FLOW IS LESS THAN 2.5 LPM AND NOTES THAT CHANGES IN PATIENT CONDITIONS CAN RESULT IN LOW FLOW. THIS IFU, AS WELL AS THE PATIENT HANDBOOK, DESCRIBES ALL SYSTEM ALARMS AND THE RECOMMENDED ACTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THEM. THE HEARTMATE 3 LVAS IFU IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. THIS IFU LISTS HYPERTENSION AND DEATH AS ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF HEARTMATE 3 LVAS. THE SECTION ENTITLED \u00bfSYSTEM MONITOR\u00bf EXPLAINS THAT THE LOW FLOW HAZARD ALARM IS TRIGGERED WHEN PUMP FLOW IS LESS THAN 2.5 LPM, THE PUMP HAS STOPPED, THE PUMP IS NOT OPERATING PROPERLY, OR THE DRIVELINE IS DISCONNECTED FROM THE SYSTEM CONTROLLER. CHANGES IN PATIENT CONDITIONS CAN RESULT IN LOW FLOW, SUCH AS HYPERTENSION. THE SECTION ENTITLED \u00bfALARMS AND TROUBLESHOOTING\u00bf EXPLAINS ALL SYSTEM ALARMS AND THE RECOMMENDED ACTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THEM. THIS DOCUMENT ALSO EXPLAINS THAT PI EVENTS ARE ASSUMED BY THE SYSTEM DURING CASES WHEN THERE ARE SUDDEN AND SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES IN THE PULSATILITY INDEX. THESE EVENTS ARE ALSO REFERRED TO AS PI EVENTS, AND MAY BE INITIATED FOR REASONS OTHER THAN TRUE PI EVENTS. SOME REASONS INCLUDE SUDDEN CHANGES IN A PATIENT\u00bfS VOLUME STATUS, ARRHYTHMIAS, SUDDEN CHANGES IN POWER, AND SUDDEN CHANGES IN PUMP SPEED. IF THE SYSTEM DETECTS A PI EVENT, THE PUMP SPEED AUTOMATICALLY DROPS TO THE LOW SPEED LIMIT AND SLOWLY RAMPS BACK UP AT A RATE OF 100 RPM PER SECOND TO THE FIXED SPEED SETPOINT. THIS DROP IN SPEED IS ACCOMPANIED BY A REDUCED PUMP FLOW. THERE ARE NO AUDIBLE ALARMS WITH A PI EVENT. THE HEARTMATE 3 LVAS PATIENT HANDBOOK IS ALSO AVAILABLE.

THE 14FR ESHEATH WAS RETURNED TO EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES FOR EVALUATION. VISUAL INSPECTION REVEALED THE SHEATH SHAFT WAS SEPARATED FROM THE SHEATH HOUSING. THE PROXIMAL STRAIN RELIEF WAS STRETCHED AND TORN BY THE PROXIMAL SHEATH SHAFT FLARE. THE PROXIMAL FLARE ON THE SHEATH SHAFT WAS DAMAGED. THE SEPARATION WAS CAUSED BY THE FAILURE OF THE SHAFT-TO-HOUSING COMPRESSION FIT, NOT A COMPONENT/MATERIAL FAILURE. ADHESIVE WAS PRESENT ON THE SHEATH HOUSING COMNUT AND STRAIN RELIEF. IT WAS ALSO OBSERVED THAT THE DISTAL 1.5 INCHES OF THE SHEATH WAS NOT EXPANDED. THE LINER WAS TORN, THE TEAR WAS APPROXIMATELY 0.5 INCHES IN LENGTH AND LOCATED 5.5 INCHES PROXIMAL FROM THE SOFT TIP. SCRATCHES WERE OBSERVED ALONG THE SHEATH SHAFT, INDICATIVE OF SHEATH INTERACTION WITH CALCIFICATION. THE SHEATH SHAFT WAS ALSO OBSERVED TO BE CURVED, INDICATIVE OF SHEATH INSERTION IN TORTUOUS ANATOMY. NO CASE IMAGERY OR DEVICE PHOTOGRAPHS WERE PROVIDED FOR REVIEW. FUNCTIONAL TESTING WAS NOT ABLE TO BE PERFORMED DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE COMPLAINT. DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS OF THE SINGLE WALL THICKNESS OF THE LINER WAS PERFORMED. MEASURED COMPONENTS WERE WITHIN SPECIFICATIONS. DEVICE HISTORY REVIEW (DHR) REVIEW WAS PERFORMED FOR THE COMPONENTS MOST RELEVANT TO THE REPORTED EVENT. THE WORK ORDERS DID NOT REVEAL ANY MANUFACTURING NON-CONFORMANCES THAT COULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE REPORTED EVENT. LOT HISTORY REVIEW REVEALED NO OTHER SIMILAR COMPLAINTS FOR THE ASSOCIATED COMPLAINT CODES. COMPLAINT HISTORY REVIEW FROM (B)(6) 2019 TO (B)(6) 2020 FOR THE EDWARDS ESHEATH REVEALED NO OTHER RETURNED COMPLAINTS FOR THE INITIAL COMPLAINT EVENT. THE COMPLAINT HISTORY REVIEW REVEALED OTHER RETURNED COMPLAINTS FOR THE OTHER COMPLAINT EVENTS. REVIEW OF COMPLAINT HISTORY REVEALED THAT THE OCCURRENCE RATE DID NOT EXCEED THE (B)(6) 2020 CONTROL LIMIT FOR THE APPROPRIATE TREND CATEGORIES. PER IFU AND TRAINING MANUALS CORRECTLY ORIENT DELIVERY SYSTEM AND CHECK POSITION BEFORE INSERTION. ORIENT THE DELIVERY SYSTEM WITH THE FLUSH PORT POINTING AWAY AND THE EDWARDS LOGO FACING UP. ENSURE DELIVERY SYSTEM IS LOCKED IN DEFAULT POSITION. NOTE: MAINTAIN EDWARDS LOGO UP THROUGHOUT THE PROCEDURE TO PREVENT KINKING OF THE DELIVERY SYSTEM. INSERTION FORCE THROUGH THE PARTIALLY EXPANDABLE PORTION CAN BE HIGHER THAN THE PUSH FORCE THROUGH THE FULLY EXPANDABLE PORTION. PUSH FORCE CAN VARY DUE TO ANGLE OF INSERTION, THV SIZE, VESSEL DIAMETER, TORTUOSITY AND DEGREE OF CALCIFICATION. IF PUSH FORCE IS HIGH, CONSIDER SLIGHTLY PULLING BACK THE SHEATH WHILE ADVANCING THE THV/DELIVERY SYSTEM 1 ? 2 CM. NOTE: IN EXPECTATION OF HIGH FRICTION, USE SHORT MOVEMENTS. EDWARDS PROVIDES TRAINING MANUALS AND INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE FOR EACH DELIVERY SYSTEM AND ESHEATH WHICH INCLUDE PROCEDURES FOR THE ESHEATH DEVICE PREPARATION AND USAGE. BASED UPON THE DETAILED IFU AND TRAINING MANUALS THAT ARE PROVIDED TO PHYSICIANS THERE ARE NO IFU/TRAINING MANUAL DEFICIENCIES, AS THE DOCUMENTS CONTAINED PROCEDURES FOR PROPER PATIENT ASSESSMENT AND DEVICE PREPARATION/USAGE. DURING THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS, THE SHEATH SHAFT AND SOFT TIP SCORING UNDERGO MULTIPLE 100% VISUAL INSPECTIONS. THE COMPLETED SHEATH ASSEMBLY UNDERGOES 100% VISUAL INSPECTION UNDER 3X MAGNIFICATION. THE SHEATH UNDERGOES MULTIPLE 100% VISUAL INSPECTIONS DURING FINAL INSPECTION. ADDITIONALLY, PRODUCT VERIFICATION TESTING IS ALSO PERFORMED ON A SAMPLING BASIS. THESE INSPECTIONS DURING THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS SUPPORT THAT IT IS UNLIKELY THAT A NONCONFORMANCE IN MANUFACTURING CONTRIBUTED TO THE SECOND AND THIRD COMPLAINT EVENTS. SINCE MANUFACTURING OF THIS COMPLAINT DEVICE, A CAPA WAS IMPLEMENTED TO ADDRESS A MANUFACTURING RELATED ISSUE WHICH WAS IDENTIFIED TO POTENTIALLY LEAD TO THE FIRST COMPLAINT EVENT. AS THE DEVICE WAS MANUFACTURING PRIOR TO IMPLEMENTATION OF CORRECTIVE ACTIONS, A POTENTIAL NONCONFORMANCE MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THIS COMPLAINT EVENT. IN THIS CASE, THE COMPLAINTS WERE CONFIRMED. INVESTIGATION OF THE DEVICE, COMPLAINT HISTORY, LOT HISTORY, AND DHR REVEALED NO INDICATION THAT A MANUFACTURING NON-CONFORMANCE CONTRIBUTED TO THE RESISTANCE AND LINER TEAR EVENTS. A REVIEW OF MANUFACTURING MITIGATIONS SUPPORTS THAT THE DELIVERY SYSTEM HAS PROPER INSPECTIONS IN PLACE TO DETECT ISSUES RELATED TO THE COMPLAINT EVENTS. A REVIEW OF IFU/TRAINING MATERIALS REVEALED NO DEFICIENCIES. AS STATED IN THE COMPLAINT DESCRIPTION, \u00bfDURING A TRANSFEMORAL TAVR PROCEDURE, A 26MM SAPIEN 3 ULTRA VALVE WOULD NOT TRACK THROUGH THE 14FR ESHEATH DUE TO VESSEL CHARACTERISTICS [\u00bf] VESSEL TORTUOSITY AND CALCIFICATION WAS REPORTED\u00bf. AS STATED IN THE TRAINING PROCEDURAL MATERIALS, THESE FACTORS CAN INCREASE PUSH FORCE NECESSARY TO INTRODUCE DELIVERY SYSTEM/THV THROUGH THE SHEATH. ADDITIONALLY, INTERACTION OF THE SHEATH WITH CALCIFICATION IN THE ACCESS VESSEL CAN DAMAGE THE LINER, MAKING IT SUSCEPTIBLE TO TEARING DURING ADVANCEMENT OF THE DELIVERY SYSTEM/THV. ALTHOUGH A DEFINITE ROOT CAUSE OF THE EVENTS WAS NOT ABLE DETERMINED, AVAILABLE INFORMATION SUGGESTED PATIENT FACTORS (ACCESS VESSEL TORTUOSITY, CALCIFICATION) MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE REPORTED RESISTANCE AND LINER TEAR. THE COMPLAINT FOR THE SEPARATED HEMOSTASIS VALVE WAS ALSO CONFIRMED. THE OBSERVED FAILURE MODE IS SIMILAR TO A PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED FAILURE, IN WHICH THERE IS A FAILURE OF THE COMPRESSION FIT BETWEEN THE SHEATH SHAFT AND SHEATH HOUSING. A POTENTIAL MANUFACTURING ISSUES MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE COMPLAINT EVENT. DURING MANUFACTURING OF THE SHEATH, IF 1) THE TRIM LENGTH OF THE SHEATH SHAFT PROXIMAL FLARE IS EXCESSIVE AND 2) THE INTERFACE BETWEEN THE PROXIMAL FLARE AND THE HOUSING ARE INADEQUATE, THE SHAFT AND HOUSING MAY BE SUSCEPTIBLE TO SEPARATION WHEN SUBJECTED TO LOWER TENSILE FORCES. IN RESPONSE, A CAPA WAS INITIATED TO UPDATE MANUFACTURING PROCEDURES RELATING TO THE TRIMMING OF THE SHAFT AND ASSEMBLY OF THE SHAFT/HOUSING COMPONENTS.

THE IFU CONTRAINDICATES PATIENTS WITH ILIO-FEMORAL VESSEL CHARACTERISTICS THAT WOULD PRECLUDE SAFE PLACEMENT OF SHEATHS SUCH AS SEVERE OBSTRUCTIVE CALCIFICATION OR SEVERE TORTUOSITY. PRE-PROCEDURE SCREENING AND ASSESSMENT OF THE FEMORAL/ILIAC ARTERY INTERNAL DIAMETERS WILL ENABLE THE CLINICIAN TO DETERMINE IF THE SAPIEN 3 VALVE CAN BE DELIVERED TRANSFEMORALLY. ASSESSMENT OF LOCATION AND AMOUNT OF CIRCUMFERENTIAL CALCIUM WILL AID IN DETERMINING AREAS OF REDUCED VESSEL DIAMETERS. THE OPERATORS ARE TRAINED TO MEASURE MINIMUM VESSEL DIAMETER TAKING CALCIUM INTO ACCOUNT. THE PHYSICIAN TRAINING MANUAL ALSO LISTS THE MINIMUM RECOMMENDED VESSEL SIZE FOR EACH SIZE DEVICE. IN THIS CASE, THERE WAS NO ALLEGATION OR INDICATION A DEVICE MALFUNCTION CONTRIBUTED TO THIS ADVERSE EVENT. IN THIS CASE, THERE WAS NO ALLEGATION OR INDICATION THAT A DEVICE MALFUNCTION OCCURRED DURING THE PROCEDURE.

HYBRID CLOSED-LOOP SYSTEMS SUCH AS THE MEDTRONIC MINIMED 670G (MEDTRONIC DIABETES, (B)(4) ) AUTOMATICALLY ADJUST BASAL INSULIN DELIVERY ONLY, WHILE THE USER MANUALLY PROGRAMS MEAL AND CORRECTION BOLUSES. WHILE CLOSED-LOOP SYSTEMS SHOW THESE ADVANTAGES OVER NON-INTEGRATED SYSTEMS, THEIR PERFORMANCE IS POTENTIALLY LIMITED BY THE RELATIVELY SLOW ABSORPTION OF CURRENT RAPID-ACTING INSULIN ANALOGS WHICH HAVE A DELAYED ONSET AND PROLONGED DURATION OF ACTION. ULTRA-RAPID-ACTING INSULINS WHICH HAVE AN ACCELERATED PHARMACOKINETIC (PK) AND PHARMACODYNAMIC (PD) PROFILE COULD HELP MINIMIZE THESE RAPID GLUCOSE CHANGES AND POTENTIALLY INCREASE THE TIME PATIENTS SPEND IN THE TARGET GLUCOSE RANGE. HOWEVER, THEIR USE WITH HYBRID CLOSED-LOOP SYSTEMS MUST BE EVALUATED, TO ENSURE THAT THE BASAL ALGORITHM ACCOMMODATES THIS ACCELERATED PK/PD PROFILE. ULTRA RAPID LISPRO (URLI), ANOTHER ULTRA-RAPID-ACTING INSULIN, IS A NEW FORMULATION OF INSULIN LISPRO WITH 2 ENABLING EXCIPIENTS (TREPROSTINIL AND CITRATE) THAT FACILITATE RAPID ABSORPTION OF INSULIN LISPRO INTO THE BLOOD STREAM. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO COMPARE URLI TO LISPRO WITH RESPECT TO THE PERCENTAGE OF TIME WITH SENSOR GLUCOSE VALUES WITHIN TARGET RANGE 3.9-10.0 MMOL/L (70-180 MG/DL; %TIR) WHEN BOTH WERE DELIVERED BY CSII WITH THE MEDTRONIC MINIMED 670G SYSTEM USING THE AUTO MODE FEATURE. THIS WAS A DOUBLE-BLIND, 2-PERIOD, CROSSOVER, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL EVALUATING THE EFFICACY OF URLI COMPARED WITH LISPRO IN ADULTS WITH TYPE 1 DIABETES ON CSII THERAPY USING THE 670G HYBRID CLOSED-LOOP SYSTEM. THE STUDY INCLUDED A 2-WEEK LEAD-IN PERIOD PRIOR TO RANDOMIZATION, FOLLOWED BY TWO 4-WEEK TREATMENT PERIODS (WITH NO WASHOUT BETWEEN TREATMENTS) AND A 2-WEEK SAFETY FOLLOW-UP. MAIN INCLUSION CRITERIA WERE AGE =18 YEARS; CLINICALLY DIAGNOSED WITH TYPE 1 DIABETES AND CONTINUOUSLY USING INSULIN FOR AT LEAST ONE YEAR; USING CSII THERAPY FOR =6 MONTHS; USING A 670G INSULIN PUMP IN AUTO MODE FOR =90 DAYS PRIOR TO SCREENING; USING AUTO MODE AT LEAST 70% OF THE TIME PER WEEK DURING THE 4 WEEKS PRIOR TO SCREENING; HBA1C =6.0% AND =8.0%; AND BMI =35 KG/M2. PATIENTS WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE STUDY IF THEY HAD HYPOGLYCEMIA UNAWARENESS; EXPERIENCED >1 EPISODE OF SEVERE HYPOGLYCEMIA WITHIN THE 6 MONTHS PRIOR TO SCREENING; HAD ANY EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISIT OR HOSPITALIZATION DUE TO POOR BLOOD GLUCOSE CONTROL (HYPERGLYCEMIA OR DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS) WITHIN 6 MONTHS PRIOR TO SCREENING; HAD SIGNIFICANT LIPOHYPERTROPHY, LIPOATROPHY, OR SCARS WITHIN SUBCUTANEOUS TISSUE IN AREAS OF INFUSION; HAD AN ABSCESS AT AN INFUSION SITE WITHIN 90 DAYS PRIOR TO SCREENING; OR USED A TOTAL DAILY INSULIN DOSE >100 UNITS/DAY, ON AVERAGE, OVER THE 3 DAYS PRIOR TO SCREENING. AT THE START OF LEAD-IN, PATIENTS WHO WERE NOT USING LISPRO WERE SWITCHED FROM THEIR RAPID-ACTING INSULIN ANALOG TO LISPRO UNIT-FOR-UNIT. FOLLOWING THE LEAD-IN PERIOD, A 3-DAY PILOT SAFETY ASSESSMENT WAS CONDUCTED AT A SINGLE SITE FOR THE FIRST 10 PATIENTS RANDOMIZED PRIOR TO EXPANDING ENROLLMENT IN THE STUDY. AFTER EVALUATING PATIENT SAFETY (INCLUDING EPISODES OF SEVERE HYPOGLYCEMIA AND SEVERE HYPERGLYCEMIA), IT WAS DETERMINED TO CONTINUE WITH THE STUDY. ELIGIBLE PATIENTS WERE THEN RANDOMIZED 1:1 TO 4 WEEKS OF URLI OR LISPRO THEN CROSSED OVER TO THE OTHER INSULIN FOR AN ADDITIONAL 4 WEEKS. ASSIGNMENT TO TREATMENT GROUPS WAS DETERMINED BY A COMPUTER-GENERATED RANDOM SEQUENCE USING AN INTERACTIVE WEB-RESPONSE SYSTEM AND STRATIFIED BY HBA1C STRATUM AT SCREENING (=7.0%, >7.0%) AND %TIR OVER THE 2 WEEKS PRIOR TO RANDOMIZATION (=75%, >75%). THROUGHOUT THE STUDY, PATIENTS USED THEIR PERSONAL 670G INSULIN PUMP AND CARELINK PERSONAL SOFTWARE, AND THE STUDY PROVIDED MINIMED RESERVOIRS, MIO INFUSION SETS, CONTOUR NEXT LINK 2.4 GLUCOSE METER, MEDTRONIC GUARDIAN SENSOR 3, AND GUARDIAN LINK 3 TRANSMITTER. PATIENTS FILLED THEIR PUMP RESERVOIRS FROM BLINDED VIALS WITH EACH INFUSION SET CHANGE, AND BOLUSES WERE DELIVERED AT MEALTIME (0-2 MINUTES PRIOR TO MEALS) USING THE SAME BOLUS DELIVERY SPEED USED AT SCREENING I.E., STANDARD (1.5 UNITS/MIN) OR QUICK BOLUS DELIVERY SPEED (15 UNITS/MIN). PATIENTS WERE REQUIRED TO USE THE AUTO MODE INSULIN DELIVERY FUNCTION AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE THROUGHOUT THE STUDY, COMPLETING ANY ACTIONS INDICATED ON THE PUMP SCREEN TO RETURN TO AUTO MODE, IF EXITED. THE PUMP RESERVOIR AND INFUSION SETS WERE TO BE CHANGED EVERY 3 DAYS UNLESS A CHANGE WAS REQUIRED DUE TO A FAILURE OF THE INFUSION SET. UNPLANNED INFUSION SET CHANGES WERE DOCUMENTED IN THE PATIENT\u00bfS STUDY DIARY. THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT WAS THE PERCENTAGE OF TIME WITH SENSOR GLUCOSE VALUES BETWEEN 3.9 AND 10.0 MMOL/L (BOTH INCLUSIVE), DURING THE LAST 2 WEEKS OF EACH 4-WEEK TREATMENT PERIOD. KEY SECONDARY ENDPOINTS INCLUDED THE MEAN SENSOR GLUCOSE VALUE, PERCENTAGE OF TIME SPENT IN AUTO MODE PER WEEK, AND THE PERCENTAGE OF TIME WITH SENSOR GLUCOSE VALUES <3.0 MMOL/L (54 MG/DL) DURING THE LAST 2 WEEKS OF EACH 4-WEEK TREATMENT PERIOD. ANALYSES OF ADVERSE EVENTS (AES) INCLUDED ALL DATA COLLECTED DURING THE ENTIRE 4-WEEK TREATMENT PERIOD FOR EACH TREATMENT REGARDLESS OF INVESTIGATIVE PRODUCT (IP) USE. THERE WERE NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN TREATMENTS IN THE MEAN TIME IN TARGET RANGE FOR THE DAYTIME, NIGHTTIME, AND 24-HOUR PERIODS (ALL P>0.1).

THE CURRENT STUDY COMPARED PROCEED (TREATMENT), A COMBINATION OF GELATIN-BASED MATRIX AND THROMBIN SOLUTION, WITH GELFOAM-THROMBIN (CONTROL), A GELFOAM SPONGE SOAKED IN THROMBIN COMMONLY USED AS A TOPICAL HEMOSTATIC AGENT, IN STOPPING INTRAOPERATIVE BLEEDING. THIS REPORT DESCRIBES THE RESULTS OF THE SPINAL COHORT OF A MULTICENTER, MULTISPECIALTY TRIAL THAT INVOLVED PATIENTS UNDERGOING SPINAL, CARDIAC, AND VASCULAR SURGERY PROCEDURES. METHODS: FOUR CENTERS RANDOMIZED 127 PATIENTS FROM A TOTAL OF 140 ENROLLED PATIENTS OVER A 7-MONTH PERIOD IN A PROSPECTIVE, RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED TRIAL. THE INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR ENROLLMENT ELIGIBILITY SPECIFIED PATIENTS 21 YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER, UNDERGOING SPINAL SURGERY, WILLING AND ABLE TO COMPLETE ALL FOLLOW-UP VISITS WHO HAD SIGNED THE INFORMED CONSENT FORM. EXCLUSION CRITERIA WERE PREGNANCY OR A KNOWN SENSITIVITY TO ANY COMPONENTS OF BOVINE THROMBIN PREPARATIONS OR ANY MATERIAL OF BOVINE ORIGIN. A BASELINE BLOOD SAMPLE WAS OBTAINED WITHIN 24 HOURS BEFORE SURGERY FOR MEASUREMENT OF COMPLETE BLOOD COUNT, BLOOD CELL DIFFERENTIALS, ACTIVATED PARTIAL THROMBOPLASTIN TIME, PROTHROMBIN TIME, AND METABOLIC PANELS. IN ADDITION, SERUM WAS ASSAYED FOR ANTIBODIES AGAINST BOVINE THROMBIN AND BOVINE FACTOR VA USING THE METHOD OF TARANTINO ET AL. ENROLLMENT WAS LIMITED TO PATIENTS WITH A BLEEDING SITE FOR WHICH CONVENTIONAL MEANS TO STOP BLEEDING, INCLUDING DIRECT PRESSURE, SUTURE, OR ELECTROCOAGULATION, WERE IMPRACTICAL OR UNSUCCESSFUL. AFTER A BLEEDING LESION REQUIRING A TOPICAL HEMOSTATIC AGENT WAS IDENTIFIED, A RANDOMIZATION ENVELOPE WAS OPENED IN THE OPERATING ROOM, AND THE PATIENT WAS RANDOMIZED TO EITHER GELFOAM- THROMBIN OR PROCEED. ALL BLEEDING SITES IN THAT PATIENT WERE CONTROLLED ONLY WITH THE HEMOSTATIC AGENT TO WHICH THE PATIENT HAD BEEN RANDOMIZED. CROSSOVER BETWEEN TREATMENT GROUPS WAS NOT ALLOWED. THE BLEEDING SEVERITY AT EACH SITE WAS CHARACTERIZED AS \\\"OOZING,\\\" \\\"FLOWING,\\\" OR \\\"PULSATILE.\\\" AFTER APPLICATION OF THE HEMOSTATIC PRODUCT, CONTINUED BLEEDING WAS RECORDED AT 1, 2, 3, 6, AND 10 MINUTES. REAPPLICATION OF THE ASSIGNED PRODUCT WAS PERMITTED. THE PRIMARY END POINT WAS CESSATION OF BLEEDING AT THE FIRST TREATED SITE WITHIN 10 MINUTES. SECONDARY END POINTS INCLUDED THE OUTCOME AT ADDITIONAL TREATED BLEEDING SITES AND TIME TO CESSATION OF BLEEDING. PROCEED (FUSION MEDICAL TECHNOLOGIES, MOUNTAIN VIEW, CA) WAS PREPARED IMMEDIATELY BEFORE USE AFTER THE PATIENT HAD BEEN RANDOMIZED BY DISPERSING BOVINE THROMBIN IN THE GELATIN MATRIX GRANULES TO A FINAL CONCENTRATION OF APPROXIMATELY 800 U/ML. PROCEED WAS DELIVERED TO THE SITE OF BLEEDING VIA A SINGLE-BARREL SYRINGE AND HELD IN PLACE WITH A GAUZE SPONGE FOR 10 MINUTES OR UNTIL THE BLEEDING STOPPED. THE CONTROL HEMOSTATIC AGENT, GELFOAM 12 OR GELFOAM 100 (PHARMACIA AND UPJOHN), WAS OPENED AT THE TIME OF RANDOMIZATION AND SOAKED IN BOVINE THROMBIN (JONES PHARMA, ST. LOUIS, MO) RECONSTITUTED TO 1000 U/ML. THE GELFOAM-THROMBIN WAS APPLIED TO THE BLEEDING SITE ALONG WITH LIGHT PRESSURE FOR 10 MINUTES OR UNTIL THE BLEEDING HAD STOPPED. INTRAOPERATIVE BLOOD LOSS WAS ESTIMATED RETROSPECTIVELY FROM THE ANESTHESIA RECORD OF EACH PATIENT. TOTAL PROCEDURE TIME WAS ESTIMATED FROM THE \\\"TIME OF INITIAL SKIN INCISION\\\" TO THE \\\"TIME OF FINAL SKIN CLOSURE.\\\" SAFETY AND ADVERSE EVENTS WERE ASSESSED AT 12 TO 36 HOURS, THEN AT 6 TO 8 WEEKS AFTER SURGERY. ADVERSE EVENTS CATEGORIZED AS \\\"MILD,\\\" \\\"MODERATE,\\\" AND \\\"SEVERE\\\" WERE ASSESSED BY THE SURGEONS AS \\\"UNRELATED,\\\" \\\"POSSIBLY RELATED,\\\" \\\"PROBABLY RELATED,\\\" OR \\\"RELATIONSHIP UNKNOWN\\\" TO THE HEMOSTATIC AGENT USED. HEMATOLOGY AND BLOOD CHEMISTRY ASSAYS WERE PERFORMED AS BEFORE AT THE 12- TO 36-HOUR, THEN AT THE 6- TO 8-WEEK POSTOPERATIVE EVALUATION. IN ADDITION, AT THE 6- TO 8-WEEK FOLLOW-UP ASSESSMENT, PATIENT SERA WERE COLLECTED FOR ANTIBODIES AGAINST BOVINE THROMBIN AND BOVINE FACTOR VA. THE PATIENTS IN THIS REPORT COMPRISED THE SPINAL COHORT OF THE MULTISPECIALTY STUDY. THE TOTAL STUDY SAMPLE INCLUDED 309 PATIENTS (153 CONTROL PATIENTS AND 156 TREATMENT PATIENTS) UNDERGOING SPINAL, CARDIAC, AND VASCULAR SURGERY. INSTITUTIONS WERE BLOCK RANDOMIZED, AND THE EFFECTIVENESS RESULTS FOR THE PRIMARY END POINT WERE ANALYZED STATISTICALLY IN AN INTENT-TO-TREAT FASHION USING THE COCHRAN-MANTEL-HAENSZEL TEST STRATIFIED BY INVESTIGATIONAL SITE. COMPARISON BETWEEN THE BASELINE AND THE 6- TO 8-WEEK ANTIBODY TITERS AS WELL AS THE OUT-OF-REFERENCE RANGE LABORATORY RESULTS BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS WAS PERFORMED BY FISHER'S EXACT TEST. RESULTS: FOR THIS STUDY, 140 PATIENTS UNDERGOING SPINAL SURGERY WERE SCREENED. OF THESE, 127 PATIENTS WERE RANDOMIZED, WITH 65 PATIENTS IN THE TREATMENT (PROCEED) GROUP AND 62 PATIENTS IN THE CONTROL (GELFOAM-THROMBIN) GROUP. THE REMAINING 13 PATIENTS WERE NOT RANDOMIZED INTO THE STUDY EITHER BECAUSE THEY FAILED TO MEET THE INTRAOPERATIVE INCLUSION CRITERIA (NO INTRAOPERATIVE BLEEDING REQUIRING THE USE OF A TOPICAL HEMOSTATIC AGENT) OR WITHDREW FROM THE STUDY BEFORE SURGERY. THE 65 PATIENTS IN THE TREATMENT GROUP HAD A TOTAL OF 180 BLEEDING SITES, AND THE 62 PATIENTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP HAD A TOTAL OF 170 BLEEDING SITES THAT WERE TREATED. ON THE AVERAGE, THE SEVERITY OF BLEEDING WAS MORE AGGRESSIVE IN THE TREATMENT GROUP THAN IN THE CONTROL GROUP. HEMOSTASIS SUCCESS, DEFINED AS CESSATION OF BLEEDING WITHIN 10 MINUTES OF TOPICAL HEMOSTATIC AGENT APPLICATION, WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER STATISTICALLY IN THE TREATMENT GROUP THAN IN THE CONTROL GROUP FOR THE FIRST BLEEDING SITE TREATED (P = 0.042), AND FOR ALL THE BLEEDING SITES TREATED (P = 0.001). THE TIMES TO HEMOSTASIS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY SHORTER IN THE TREATMENT GROUP THAN IN THE CONTROL GROUP FOR THE FIRST BLEEDING SITE TREATED AS WELL AS FOR ALL THE BLEEDING SITES TREATED.

OBJECTIVES: CENTRAL VENOUS ACCESS DEVICES ENABLE MANY TREATMENTS DURING CRITICAL ILLNESS; HOWEVER, 25% OF PEDIATRIC CENTRAL VENOUS ACCESS DEVICES FAIL BEFORE COMPLETION OF TREATMENT DUE TO INFECTION, THROMBOSIS, DISLODGEMENT, AND OCCLUSION. THIS IS FREQUENTLY ATTRIBUTED TO INADEQUATE SECUREMENT AND DRESSING OF THE DEVICE; HOWEVER, HIGH-QUALITY RESEARCH EVALUATING PEDIATRIC CENTRAL VENOUS ACCESS DEVICE SECUREMENT INNOVATION TO PREVENT CENTRAL VENOUS ACCESS DEVICE FAILURE IS SCARCE. THIS STUDY AIMED TO ESTABLISH THE FEASIBILITY OF A DEFINITIVE RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL EXAMINING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CURRENT AND NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO SECURE CENTRAL VENOUS ACCESS DEVICES IN PEDIATRICS. METHODS: DESIGN: SINGLE-CENTER, PARALLEL GROUP, SUPERIORITY, PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL. SETTING: ANESTHETIC AND INTENSIVE CARE DEPARTMENTS OF A TERTIARY PEDIATRIC HOSPITAL SUBJECTS: ONE-HUNDRED EIGHTY PEDIATRIC PATIENTS WITH NON-TUNNELED CENTRAL VENOUS ACCESS DEVICE. INTERVENTIONS: PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO RECEIVE CENTRAL VENOUS ACCESS DEVICE SECUREMENT VIA STANDARD CARE (BORDERED POLYURETHANE DRESSING, WITH PROLENE SUTURES, CHLORHEXIDINE GLUCONATE DISC), TISSUE ADHESIVE (HISTOACRYL, B BRAUN, MELSUNGEN, GERMANY) IN ADDITION TO STANDARD CARE; OR INTEGRATED DRESSING SECUREMENT (SORBAVIEW SHIELD [CENTURION MEDICAL PRODUCTS, FRANKLIN, MA], WITH PROLENE SUTURES AND CHLORHEXIDINE GLUCONATE DISC). RESULTS:PRIMARY: FEASIBILITY (INCLUDING EFFECT SIZE ESTIMATES, ACCEPTABILITY); CENTRAL VENOUS ACCESS DEVICE FAILURE; CENTRAL VENOUS ACCESS DEVICE COMPLICATIONS; SECONDARY: INDIVIDUAL CENTRAL VENOUS ACCESS DEVICE COMPLICATIONS, SKIN DAMAGE, DRESSING PERFORMANCE, AND PRODUCT COST. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: FEASIBILITY CRITERIA WERE ACHIEVED AS RECRUITMENT OCCURRED WITH ACCEPTABLE ELIGIBILITY, RECRUITMENT, MISSING DATA, AND ATTRITION RATES, AS WELL AS GOOD PROTOCOL ADHERENCE. FAMILY MEMBERS AND STAFF-REPORTED COMPARABLE LEVELS OF ACCEPTABILITY BETWEEN STUDY ARMS; HOWEVER, TISSUE ADHESIVE WAS REPORTED AS THE MOST DIFFICULT TO APPLY. OVERALL, 6% OF CENTRAL VENOUS ACCESS DEVICES FAILED, INCLUDING 6% (3/54; INCIDENT RATE, 13.2 PER 1,000 CATHETER DAYS) STANDARD CARE, 2% (1/56; INCIDENT RATE, 3.65 PER 1,000 CATHETER DAYS) INTEGRATED, AND 8% (5/59; 25.0 PER 1,000 CATHETER DAYS) TISSUE ADHESIVE. DEATH \u00bf THERE WERE 3 DOCUMENTED DEATHS. PARTICIPANTS WERE ON AVERAGE 38 MONTHS OLD (INTERQUARTILE RANGE [IQR], 33\u00bf61), UNDERGOING A CARDIAC SURGICAL PROCEDURE (126/174; 72%), WITH A MEDIAN PEDIATRIC INDEX OF MORTALITY 3 OF 0.5 (IQR, 0.3\u00bf 1.4). THERE WAS NO MENTION OF A CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP WITH BIOPATCH, BUT RATHER THAT THREE PARTICIPANTS HAD DIED AFTER THEIR ADMISSION TO THE PEDIATRIC INTENSIVE CARE UNIT WHILE ON THIS TRIAL. CONCLUSIONS: IT IS FEASIBLE TO CONDUCT AN EFFICACY RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL OF THE STUDIED INTERVENTIONS.

ON 14-MAY-2021, (UNKNOWN LATENCY) AFTER THE INITIATION OF THE SUSPECT DEVICE, ANOTHER PARTICIPANT'S DATA WAS NO LONGER DISPLAYING IN THE PORTAL.(DEVICE MALFUNCTION). THIS EVENT WAS ASSESSED AS INTERVENTION REQUIRED. NO RELEVANT LABORATORY DATA WAS REPORTED. ACTION TAKEN WITH SUSPECT DEVICE WAS NOT APPLICABLE. IT WAS UNKNOWN, IF THE PATIENT RECEIVED ANY CORRECTIVE TREATMENT. AT TIME OF REPORTING, THE OUTCOME WAS UNKNOWN FOR THE EVENT DEVICE MALFUNCTION. SAMPLE STATUS - NOT AVAILABLE INVESTIGATION RESULTS: 28-MAY-2021 VS (ANALYST NAME ABBREVIATION) INVESTIGATION CONCLUSION: RELATED TO PRODUCT. LOOKING AT THE PATIENT DATA FILE IT SEEMS THAT BOTH APPS WERE NOT SYNCING OBSERVATIONS WITH THE SERVER. THERE WERE OTHER REQUESTS COMING IN FROM THE APP WHICH WERE BEING SUCCESSFULLY RESPONDED TO BY THE SERVER. THIS WAS AN INDICATION THAT THE APP TO SERVER COMMUNICATION WAS WORKING. THE LAST SUCCESSFUL REQUEST TO SYNC AN OBSERVATION WAS MADE ON 13-MAY-2021. APP HAD NOT MADE A SYNC REQUEST SINCE THAT DATE. ONCE ACTIVATED, THE PATIENT COULD USE THE APPLICATION AND RECEIVE DOSE RECOMMENDATION WITHOUT FURTHER INTERVENTION BY THE HCP (HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL) UNTIL THE DOSE PLAN EXPIRES, AS CONFIGURED BY THE HCP. THE DOSE RECOMMENDATIONS WERE CALCULATED LOCALLY ON THE MOBILE APPLICATION AND DID NOT REQUIRE DAILY INTERVENTION FROM THE HCP. WHILE THE HCP PORTAL WAS MISSING THE OBSERVATIONS, THE PATIENT COULD STILL SEE THEIR DATA AND USE THE APPLICATION AND RECEIVE THE NECESSARY NOTIFICATIONS, WARNINGS, AND DOSE RECOMMENDATIONS. FOR THE AFFECTED PATIENTS THE DOSE WAS ADJUSTED BASED ON THEIR CURRENT ACTIVE DOSE PLAN PRESCRIBED BY THEIR HCP. THERE WAS NO NOTIFICATION TO THE HCP OR PATIENT THAT THE APP WAS NOT SYNCING OBSERVATION DATA. RISK ASSESSMENT: NO PATIENTS HAD EXPERIENCED AN ADVERSE EFFECT FROM THIS ISSUE. THE HCP WAS MISSING PATIENT DATA AND COULD NOT TRACK PATIENT COMPLIANCE WHICH WAS AN S1 LEVEL RISK DUE TO POTENTIAL DELAY OF THERAPY. HOWEVER, IN LINE WITH THE RISK FILE AND HIGHEST MEDICAL RISK, THIS ISSUE COULD RESULT IN A DELAY OF THERAPY (S1), HYPERGLYCEMIA (S2), OR HYPOGLYCEMIA (S3) IF CURRENT RISK CONTROLS WERE NOT EFFECTIVE. THE HCP COULD POTENTIALLY INCORRECTLY UPDATE THE PATIENT CARE PLAN BASED ON MISSING DATA. IN THIS SPECIFIC SITUATION, THERE WAS NO PATIENT HARM AS THE HCP/CLINICAL TRIAL STAFF RECOGNIZED THAT THE DATA WAS MISSING. THE US (UPMC STUDY) TEAM HAD BEEN MONITORING PATIENT DATA AND CURRENT RISK MITIGATIONS HELPED PREVENT AN S2 OR S3 IN THIS SCENARIO. THE PATIENT COULD STILL USE THE APPLICATION AND RECEIVE THE NECESSARY NOTIFICATIONS, WARNINGS, AND DOSE RECOMMENDATIONS. THE DOSE WAS BEING ADJUSTED AS EXPECTED BASED ON THE PATIENT'S CARE PLAN. THE DATA WAS AVAILABLE ON THE PATIENT APPLICATION, BUT THE PATIENT DATA WAS NOT BEING TRANSFERRED TO THE HCP PORTAL FOR AN UNKNOWN TIME PERIOD. IN THE PREVIOUS RELATED CASE PTC NUMBER 100118387, THE DATA WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE HCP PORTAL AT A LATER DATE AND NO DATA WAS LOST. MDC V2.4 WAS CURRENTLY ONLY BEING USED FOR THE UPMC CLINICAL TRIAL WITH CLINICAL ADMIN OVERSIGHT. CONCLUSION: ESR-494 WAS THE SAME ISSUE AS ESR-462 (PTC NUMBER 100118387) AND NO ROOT CAUSE HAD BEEN IDENTIFIED THUS FAR. INVESTIGATION WAS STILL ONGOING. NO PATIENTS HAD EXPERIENCED AN ADVERSE EFFECT FROM THIS ISSUE. ADDITIONALLY, THERE WAS NO PATIENT HARM. SANOFI HAD INSTRUCTED THE UPMC STUDY COORDINATOR TO CONTACT THE AFFECTED PATIENTS IN ORDER TO LET THEM KNOW ABOUT THE TEMPORARY INABILITY OF THE HCP TO MONITOR PATIENT'S DATA AND CONTACT STUDY CARE TEAM IN CASE PATIENT HAD ANY QUESTIONS. FINAL INVESTIGATION COMPLETE DATE: 02-JUN-2021 NO FURTHER RELEVANT INFORMATION WAS REPORTED. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING A PRODUCT TECHNICAL COMPLAINT (PTC) WAS INITIATED FOR MY DOSE COACH. BATCH NUMBER AND EXPIRATION DATE WERE UNKNOWN. GLOBAL PTC NUMBER: 100129331, WAS RECEIVED ON 21-JUN-2021: SAMPLE STATUS- NOT AVAILABLE INVESTIGATION RESULTS: 2021-06-21 VOLHA SAUCHANKA (ANALYST): ESR-494: EMAIL RECEIVED BY UPMC STUDY COORDINATOR ON 16 MAY 2021: HI, ANOTHER PARTICIPANTS DATA IS NO LONGER DISPLAYING IN THE PORTAL. THE DATA STOPPED SHOWING IN THE PORTAL AS OF FRIDAY, MAY 14TH. THE ENROLLMENT DATE IS 21 APRIL 2021. INVESTIGATION RESULTS: ANALYSIS OF THE REPORTED INFORMATION AND DE-IDENTIFIED DATA SHOWS THAT THE IOS APP INTERMITTENTLY STOPS SENDING THE DATA TO THE BACKEND SERVICES WHEN IT FAILS TO RENEW THE EXCHANGE TOKEN. A SECURED TOKEN IS USED BY THE IOS APP TO SEND OBSERVATION DATA (DOSE, AD-HOC BG, FBG ETC.) TO THE BACKEND WHICH IS USED BY THE PORTAL. AN EXPIRED TOKEN CAUSES THE APP TO NOT SYNC THE DATA WITH THE BACKEND, FURTHERMORE THE APP ALSO STOPPED ANY FUTURE ATTEMPTS TO SYNC THE DATA WHEN TOKEN EXPIRED THIS ERROR WOULD BE CORRECTED WHENEVER THE APP WAS RESTARTED. THIS RESULTED IN INTERMITTENT BEHAVIOR WHERE DATA DID NOT SYNC AND THEN SUDDENLY SHOWED UP ON THE PORTAL. THIS HAPPENED FOR A USER WHEN THE TRIAL COORDINATOR WORKED WITH THE PATIENT TO TROUBLESHOOTING THIS ISSUE RESULTING IN THE APP BEING RESTARTED. THE FIX FOR THIS ISSUE WILL BE IMPLEMENTED AS PART OF AN UPDATE RELEASE. RISK ASSESSMENT NO PATIENTS HAVE EXPERIENCED AN ADVERSE EFFECT FROM THIS ISSUE. THE HCP IS MISSING PATIENT DATA AND CANNOT TRACK PATIENT COMPLIANCE WHICH IS AN S1 LEVEL RISK DUE TO POTENTIAL DELAY OF THERAPY.

THIS AUTHOR REPORTED DIFFERENT EVENTS FOR TWO PATIENTS. THIS IS FIRST OF TWO REPORTS.A PATIENT STARTED TO RECEIVE ABSORBABLE GELATIN (GELFOAM) GELFOAM 12 OR GELFOAM 100 (UPJOHN AND PHARMACIA, KALAMAZOO, MI), OPENED AT THE TIME OF RANDOMIZATION AND SOAKED IN BOVINE THROMBIN (JONES MEDICAL INDUSTRIES, INC, ST LOUIS, MO) RECONSTITUTED TO 1000 U/ML ACCORDING TO THE MANUFACTURER'S INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE TO CONTROL PERIOPERATIVE BLEEDING. THE PATIENT MEDICAL HISTORY AND CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS WERE NOT REPORTED. THE PATIENT EXPERIENCED POSTOPERATIVE BLEEDING, REPORTED TO HAVE EITHER AN \\\"UNKNOWN\\\" OR A \\\"POSSIBLE RELATIONSHIP TO THE HEMOSTATIC AGENT USED ON AN UNSPECIFIED DATE. THE PATIENT UNDERWENT LAB TESTS AND PROCEDURES WHICH INCLUDED ACTIVATED PARTIAL THROMBOPLASTIN TIME, ANTIBODIES, BLOOD CHEMISTRY ASSAYS, COMPLETE BLOOD COUNT, HEMATOLOGIC, ENZYME LINKED IMMUNOSORBENT ASSAY (ELISA) METHOD, BLOOD CELL DIFFERENTIALS, HEPATIC PANEL, METABOLIC PANEL, PROTHROMBIN TIME AND RENAL PANEL. THE ACTION TAKEN IN RESPONSE TO THE EVENT FOR ABSORBABLE GELATIN AND THROMBIN WAS UNKNOWN. THE OUTCOME OF THE EVENT WAS RECOVERED.WE CONDUCTED A MULTICENTER, RANDOMIZED TRIAL TO COMPARE THE EFFICACY AND SAFETY OF A STANDARD CLINICAL REGIMEN OF THROMBIN-SOAKED GELFOAM (THROMBIN-GELFOAM) TO FLOSEAL MATRIX. MATERIAL AND METHODS FOUR CARDIAC CENTERS WERE INCLUDED IN A PROSPECTIVE, RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED TRIAL INVOLVING 93 PATIENTS OVER A 7-MONTH ENROLLMENT PERIOD. THE CLINICAL TRIAL INVOLVING HUMAN SUBJECTS WAS CONDUCTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE HELSINKI DECLARATION, AS AMENDED BY THE 41ST WORLD MEDICAL ASSEMBLY IN HONG KONG IN 1989, AND US CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS 21CRF PART 812. THE INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD AT EACH SITE APPROVED THE STUDY BEFORE PATIENT ENROLLMENT. BEFORE THE OPERATION, EACH PATIENT SIGNED AN INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD-APPROVED CONSENT FORM TO PARTICIPATE IN THE STUDY. TO BE ELIGIBLE, A PATIENT MUST BE AGED 21 YEARS OR OLDER; UNDERGOING CARDIOVASCULAR, VASCULAR, OR ORTHOPEDIC OPERATION; BE WILLING AND ABLE TO COMPLETE ALL FOLLOW-UP VISITS; AND SIGN AN INFORMED CONSENT FORM. PATIENTS WERE EXCLUDED IF THEY WERE PREGNANT OR IF THEY HAD A KNOWN SENSITIVITY TO ANY COMPONENTS OF BOVINE THROMBIN PREPARATIONS OR TO ANY MATERIAL OF BOVINE ORIGIN. PATIENTS WERE ENROLLED IN THE STUDY INTRAOPERATIVELY IF THEY DID NOT HAVE AN ACTIVE INFECTION AT THE OPERATIVE SITE, IF THERE WAS BLEEDING THAT REQUIRED THE USE OF A TOPICAL HEMOSTAT, AND IF THE USE OF A TOPICAL HEMOSTATIC AGENT WAS NOT CONTRAINDICATED. A BASELINE BLOOD SAMPLE WAS OBTAINED WITHIN 24 HOURS BEFORE OPERATION TO MEASURE COMPLETE BLOOD COUNT, BLOOD CELL DIFFERENTIALS, ACTIVATED PARTIAL THROMBOPLASTIN TIME, PROTHROMBIN TIME, AND METABOLIC, HEPATIC, AND RENAL PANELS. IN ADDITION, SERUM WAS USED TO ASSAY ANTIBODIES TO BOVINE THROMBIN AND BOVINE FACTOR VA BY THE ENZYMELINKED IMMUNOSORBENT ASSAY (ELISA) METHOD DESCRIBED BY TARANTINO AND COLLEAGUES. ENROLLMENT WAS LIMITED TO THOSE PATIENTS IN WHOM THE SURGEON WAS ABLE TO IDENTIFY A BLEEDING SITE FOR WHICH CONVENTIONAL MEANS TO STOP BLEEDING (INCLUDING DIRECT PRESSURE, SUTURE, AND ELECTROCOAGULATION) WERE IMPRACTICAL OR PROVED UNSUCCESSFUL. AFTER IDENTIFICATION OF A BLEEDING LESION REQUIRING A TOPICAL HEMOSTATIC AGENT, THE PATIENTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO EITHER GELFOAM-THROMBIN AS A CONTROL OR FLOSEAL. ALL BLEEDING SITES IN ANY PATIENT WERE TREATED WITH THE HEMOSTATIC AGENT TO WHICH THE PATIENT WAS RANDOMIZED. THE BLEEDING SEVERITY AT EACH SITE WAS CHARACTERIZED AS \\\"OOZING\\\" OR \\\"HEAVY BLEEDING\\\" (FLOWING OR SPURTING). AFTER APPLICATION OF THE HEMOSTATIC PRODUCT, THE OCCURRENCE OF CONTINUED BLEEDING WAS RECORDED AT 1, 2, 3, 6, AND 10 MINUTES. REAPPLICATION OF THE ASSIGNED PRODUCT WAS ALLOWED, AND THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT WAS CESSATION OF BLEEDING OF THE FIRST TREATED SITE WITHIN 10 MINUTES. SECONDARY ENDPOINTS INCLUDED THE OUTCOME OF ADDITIONAL TREATED BLEEDING SITES AND TIME TO CESSATION OF BLEEDING. FLOSEAL MATRIX (FUSION MEDICAL TECHNOLOGIES, INC, MOUNTAIN VIEW, CA) WAS PREPARED IMMEDIATELY BEFORE USE AFTER THE PATIENT HAD BEEN RANDOMIZED. FLOSEAL MATRIX WAS PREPARED BY DISPERSING BOVINE THROMBIN (JONES MEDICAL INDUSTRIES, INC, ST. LOUIS, MO) WITHIN THE GELATIN MATRIX GRANULES TO A FINAL CONCENTRATION OF 1000 UNITS/ML. THE FLOSEAL WAS DELIVERED TO THE SITE OF BLEEDING BY MEANS OF A SINGLE-BARREL SYRINGE AND HELD IN PLACE WITH A GAUZE SPONGE FOR 10 MINUTES OR UNTIL THE BLEEDING STOPPED. THE CONTROL HEMOSTATIC AGENT, GELFOAM 12 OR GELFOAM 100 (UPJOHN AND PHARMACIA, KALAMAZOO, MI), WAS OPENED AT THE TIME OF RANDOMIZATION AND SOAKED IN BOVINE THROMBIN (JONES MEDICAL INDUSTRIES, INC, ST LOUIS, MO) RECONSTITUTED TO 1000 U/ML ACCORDING TO THE MANUFACTURER'S INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE. THE GELFOAM-THROMBIN WAS APPLIED TO THE BLEEDING SITE AND LIGHT PRESSURE APPLIED FOR 10 MINUTES OR UNTIL BLEEDING HAD STOPPED. IN ALL CASES, IF THE BLEEDING PERSISTED BEYOND 10 MINUTES, THE SURGEON WAS FREE TO USE ANY HEMOSTATIC AGENT PREFERRED, EXCEPT REAPPLICATION OF FLOSEAL MATRIX, TO CONTROL THE BLEEDING. AFTER USE OF EITHER PRODUCT, SURGEONS WERE QUERIED ABOUT HANDLING CHARACTERISTICS. THE THREE QUESTIONS ASKED ADDRESSED EASE OF APPLICATION, ABILITY OF MATERIAL TO CONFORM TO TISSUE SURFACES, AND ACCESS TO DIFFICULT-TOREACH LOCATIONS. THE ANSWERS WERE GRADED ON A SCALE OF 1 (EASY OR WELL) TO 5 (DIFFICULT OR POOR). SAFETY AND ADVERSE EFFECTS WERE ASSESSED AT 12 TO 36 HOURS AND 6 TO 8 WEEKS POSTOPERATIVELY. ADVERSE EVENTS WERE CATEGORIZED AS MILD, MODERATE, OR SEVERE AND WERE ASSESSED BY THE SURGEONS AS UNRELATED, POSSIBLY RELATED, OR PROBABLY RELATED TO THE PRODUCTS USED.

There were, in addition, over 19,000 exposures from mostly open-label, European postmarketing studies. The conditions and duration of treatment with Citalopram varied greatly and included (in overlapping categories) open-label and double-blind studies, inpatient and outpatient studies, fixed-dose and dose-titration studies, and short-term and long-term exposure. Adverse reactions were assessed by collecting adverse events, results of physical examinations, vital signs, weights, laboratory analyses, ECGs, and results of ophthalmologic examinations. Adverse events during exposure were obtained primarily by general inquiry and recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events without first grouping similar types of events into a smaller number of standardized event categories. In the tables and tabulations that follow, standard World Health Organization (WHO) terminology has been used to classify reported adverse events. The stated frequencies of adverse events represent the proportion of individuals who experienced, at least once, a treatment-emergent adverse event of the type listed. An event was considered treatment-emergent if it occurred for the first time or worsened while receiving therapy following baseline evaluation. Adverse Findings Observed in Short-Term, Placebo-Controlled Trials Adverse Events Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment Among 1063 depressed patients who received citalopram at doses ranging from 10 to 80 mg/day in placebo-controlled trials of up to 6 weeks in duration, 16% discontinued treatment due to an adverse event, as compared to 8% of 446 patients receiving placebo. The adverse events associated with discontinuation and considered drug-related (i.e., associated with discontinuation in at least 1% of citalopram-treated patients at a rate at least twice that of placebo) are shown in TABLE 2 . It should be noted that one patient can report more than one reason for discontinuation and be counted more than once in this table. Adverse Events Occurring at an Incidence of 2% or More Among Citalopram-Treated Patients Table 3 enumerates the incidence, rounded to the nearest percent, of treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred among 1063 depressed patients who received citalopram at doses ranging from 10 to 80 mg/day in placebo-controlled trials of up to 6 weeks in duration. Events included are those occurring in 2% or more of patients treated with citalopram and for which the incidence in patients treated with citalopram was greater than the incidence in placebo-treated patients. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those which prevailed in the clinical trials. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. The cited figures, however, do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and non-drug factors to the adverse event incidence rate in the population studied. The only commonly observed adverse event that occurred in citalopram patients with an incidence of 5% or greater and at least twice the incidence in placebo patients was ejaculation disorder (primarily ejaculatory delay) in male patients (see TABLE 3 ). * Events reported by at least 2% of patients treated with citalopram are reported, except for the following events which had an incidence on placebo \u2265 citalopram: headache, asthenia, dizziness, constipation, palpitation, vision abnormal, sleep disorder, nervousness, pharyngitis, micturition disorder, back pain. 1 Denominator used was for females only (N = 638 citalopram; N = 252 placebo). 2 Primarily ejaculatory delay. 3 Denominator used was for males only (N = 425 citalopram; N = 194 placebo). Dose Dependency of Adverse Events The potential relationship between the dose of citalopram administered and the incidence of adverse events was examined in a fixed-dose study in depressed patients receiving placebo or citalopram 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, or 60 mg. Jonckheere\"s trend test revealed a positive dose response (p<0.05) for the following adverse events: fatigue, impotence, insomnia, sweating increased, somnolence, and yawning. Male and Female Sexual Dysfunction with SSRIs Although changes in sexual desire, sexual performance, and sexual satisfaction often occur as manifestations of a psychiatric disorder, they may also be a consequence of pharmacologic treatment. In particular, some evidence suggests that SSRIs can cause such untoward sexual experiences. Reliable estimates of the incidence and severity of untoward experiences involving sexual desire, performance, and satisfaction are difficult to obtain, however, in part because patients and physicians may be reluctant to discuss them. Accordingly, estimates of the incidence of untoward sexual experience and performance cited in product labeling, are likely to underestimate their actual incidence. The table below displays the incidence of sexual side effects reported by at least 2% of patients taking Citalopram in a pool of placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients with depression. In female depressed patients receiving citalopram, the reported incidence of decreased libido and anorgasmia was 1.3% (n= 638 females) and 1.1% (n= 252 females), respectively. There are no adequately designed studies examining sexual dysfunction with citalopram treatment. Priapism has been reported with all SSRIs. While it is difficult to know the precise risk of sexual dysfunction associated with the use of SSRIs, physicians should routinely inquire about such possible side effects. Vital Sign Changes Citalopram and placebo groups were compared with respect to (1) mean change from baseline in vital signs (pulse, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure) and (2) the incidence of patients meeting criteria for potentially clinically significant changes from baseline in these variables. These analyses did not reveal any clinically important changes in vital signs associated with citalopram treatment. In addition, a comparison of supine and standing vital sign measures for citalopram and placebo treatments indicated that citalopram treatment is not associated with orthostatic changes. Weight Changes Patients treated with citalopram in controlled trials experienced a weight loss of about 0.5 kg compared to no change for placebo patients. Laboratory Changes Citalopram and placebo groups were compared with respect to (1) mean change from baseline in various serum chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis variables, and (2) the incidence of patients meeting criteria for potentially clinically significant changes from baseline in these variables. These analyses revealed no clinically important changes in laboratory test parameters associated with citalopram treatment. ECG Changes In a thorough QT study, citalopram was found to be associated with a dose-dependent increase in the QTc interval (see WARNINGS - QT-Prolongation and Torsade de Pointes ) . Electrocardiograms from citalopram (N= 802) and placebo (N= 241) groups were compared with respect to outliers defined as subjects with QTc changes over 60 msec from baseline or absolute values over 500 msec post-dose, and subjects with heart rate increases to over 100 bpm or decreases to less than 50 bpm with a 25% change from baseline (tachycardic or bradycardic outliers, respectively). In the Citalopram group 1.9% of the patients had a change from baseline in QTcF >60 msec compared to 1.2% of the patients in the placebo group. None of the patients in the placebo group had a post-dose QTcF >500 msec compared to 0.5% of the patients in the Citalopram group. The incidence of tachycardic outliers was 0.5% in the Citalopram group and 0.4% in the placebo group. The incidence of bradycardic outliers was 0.9% in the Citalopram group and 0.4% in the placebo group. Other Events Observed During the Premarketing Evaluation of Citalopram HBr Following is a list of WHO terms that reflect treatment-emergent adverse events, as defined in the introduction to the ADVERSE REACTIONS section, reported by patients treated with citalopram at multiple doses in a range of 10 to 80 mg/day during any phase of a trial within the premarketing database of 4422 patients. All reported events are included except those already listed in Table 3 or elsewhere in labeling, those events for which a drug cause was remote, those event terms which were so general as to be uninformative, and those occurring in only one patient. It is important to emphasize that, although the events reported occurred during treatment with citalopram, they were not necessarily caused by it. Events are further categorized by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency according to the following definitions: frequent adverse events are those occurring on one or more occasions in at least 1/100 patients; infrequent adverse events are those occurring in less than 1/100 patients but at least 1/1000 patients; rare events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients.

program for citalopram HBr included citalopram exposures in patients and/or normal subjects from 3 different groups of studies: 429 normal subjects in clinical pharmacology/pharmacokinetic studies; 4422 exposures from patients in controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials, corresponding to approximately 1370 patient-exposure years. There were, in addition, over 19,000 exposures from mostly open-label, European postmarketing studies. The conditions and duration of treatment with citalopram HBr varied greatly and included (in overlapping categories) open-label and double-blind studies, inpatient and outpatient studies, fixed-dose and dose-titration studies, and short-term and long-term exposure. Adverse reactions were assessed by collecting adverse events, results of physical examinations, vital signs, weights, laboratory analyses, ECGs, and results of ophthalmologic examinations. Adverse events during exposure were obtained primarily by general inquiry and recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events without first grouping similar types of events into a smaller number of standardized event categories. In the tables and tabulations that follow, standard World Health Organization (WHO) terminology has been used to classify reported adverse events. The stated frequencies of adverse events represent the proportion of individuals who experienced, at least once, a treatment-emergent adverse event of the type listed. An event was considered treatment-emergent if it occurred for the first time or worsened while receiving therapy following baseline evaluation. Adverse Findings Observed in Short-Term, Placebo-Controlled Trials Adverse Events Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment Among 1063 depressed patients who received citalopram HBr at doses ranging from 10 to 80 mg/day in placebo-controlled trials of up to 6 weeks in duration, 16% discontinued treatment due to an adverse event, as compared to 8% of 446 patients receiving placebo. The adverse events associated with discontinuation and considered drug-related (i.e., associated with discontinuation in at least 1% of citalopram HBr-treated patients at a rate at least twice that of placebo) are shown in TABLE 2 . It should be noted that one patient can report more than one reason for discontinuation and be counted more than once in this table. TABLE 2 Adverse Events Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment in Short-Term, Placebo-Controlled, Depression Trials Percentage of Patients Discontinuing Due to Adverse Event Citalopram Placebo (N=1063) (N=446) Body System/Adverse Event General Asthenia 1% <1% Gastrointestinal Disorders Nausea 4% 0% Dry Mouth 1% <1% Vomiting 1% 0% Central and Peripheral Nervous System Disorders Dizziness 2% <1% Psychiatric Disorders Insomnia 3% 1% Somnolence 2% 1% Agitation 1% <1% Adverse Events Occurring at an Incidence of 2% or More Among Citalopram HBr-Treated Patients Table 3 enumerates the incidence, rounded to the nearest percent, of treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred among 1063 depressed patients who received citalopram HBr at doses ranging from 10 to 80 mg/day in placebo-controlled trials of up to 6 weeks in duration. Events included are those occurring in 2% or more of patients treated with citalopram HBr and for which the incidence in patients treated with citalopram HBr was greater than the incidence in placebo-treated patients. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those which prevailed in the clinical trials. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. The cited figures, however, do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and non-drug factors to the adverse event incidence rate in the population studied. The only commonly observed adverse event that occurred in citalopram HBr patients with an incidence of 5% or greater and at least twice the incidence in placebo patients was ejaculation disorder (primarily ejaculatory delay) in male patients (see TABLE 3 ). TABLE 3 Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events: Incidence in Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trials* *Events reported by at least 2% of patients treated with citalopram HBr are reported, except for the following events which had an incidence on placebo \u2265 citalopram HBr: headache, asthenia, dizziness, constipation, palpitation, vision abnormal, sleep disorder, nervousness, pharyngitis, micturition disorder, back pain. 1 Denominator used was for females only (N=638 citalopram HBr; N=252 placebo). 2 Primarily ejaculatory delay. 3 Denominator used was for males only (N=425 citalopram HBr; N=194 placebo). (Percentage of Patients Reporting Event) Body System/Adverse Event Citalopram HBr Placebo (N=1063) (N=446) Autonomic Nervous System Disorders Dry Mouth 20% 14% Sweating Increased 11% 9% Central & Peripheral Nervous System Disorders Tremor 8% 6% Gastrointestinal Disorders Nausea 21% 14% Diarrhea 8% 5% Dyspepsia 5% 4% Vomiting 4% 3% Abdominal Pain 3% 2% General Fatigue 5% 3% Fever 2% <1% Musculoskeletal System Disorders Arthralgia 2% 1% Myalgia 2% 1% Psychiatric Disorders Somnolence 18% 10% Insomnia 15% 14% Anxiety 4% 3% Anorexia 4% 2% Agitation 3% 1% Dysmenorrhea 1 3% 2% Libido Decreased 2% <1% Yawning 2% <1% Respiratory System Disorders Upper Respiratory Tract Infection 5% 4% Rhinitis 5% 3% Sinusitis 3% <1% Urogenital Ejaculation Disorder 2,3 6% 1% Impotence 3 3% <1% Dose Dependency of Adverse Events The potential relationship between the dose of citalopram HBr administered and the incidence of adverse events was examined in a fixed-dose study in depressed patients receiving placebo or citalopram HBr 10, 20, 40, and 60 mg. Jonckheere's trend test revealed a positive dose response (p<0.05) for the following adverse events: fatigue, impotence, insomnia, sweating increased, somnolence, and yawning. Male and Female Sexual Dysfunction with SSRIs Although changes in sexual desire, sexual performance, and sexual satisfaction often occur as manifestations of a psychiatric disorder, they may also be a consequence of pharmacologic treatment. In particular, some evidence suggests that SSRIs can cause such untoward sexual experiences. Reliable estimates of the incidence and severity of untoward experiences involving sexual desire, performance, and satisfaction are difficult to obtain, however, in part because patients and physicians may be reluctant to discuss them. Accordingly, estimates of the incidence of untoward sexual experience and performance cited in product labeling, are likely to underestimate their actual incidence. The table below displays the incidence of sexual side effects reported by at least 2% of patients taking citalopram HBr in a pool of placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients with depression. Treatment Citalopram HBr (425 males) Placebo (194 males) Abnormal Ejaculation (mostly ejaculatory delay) 6.1% (males only) 1% (males only) Libido Decreased 3.8% (males only) <1% (males only) Impotence 2.8% (males only) <1% (males only) In female depressed patients receiving citalopram HBr, the reported incidence of decreased libido and anorgasmia was 1.3% (n=638 females) and 1.1% (n=252 females), respectively. There are no adequately designed studies examining sexual dysfunction with citalopram treatment. Priapism has been reported with all SSRIs. While it is difficult to know the precise risk of sexual dysfunction associated with the use of SSRIs, physicians should routinely inquire about such possible side effects. Vital Sign Changes Citalopram HBr and placebo groups were compared with respect to (1) mean change from baseline in vital signs (pulse, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure) and (2) the incidence of patients meeting criteria for potentially clinically significant changes from baseline in these variables. These analyses did not reveal any clinically important changes in vital signs associated with citalopram HBr treatment. In addition, a comparison of supine and standing vital sign measures for citalopram HBr and placebo treatments indicated that citalopram HBr treatment is not associated with orthostatic changes. Weight Changes Patients treated with citalopram HBr in controlled trials experienced a weight loss of about 0.5 kg compared to no change for placebo patients. Laboratory Changes Citalopram HBr and placebo groups were compared with respect to (1) mean change from baseline in various serum chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis variables, and (2) the incidence of patients meeting criteria for potentially clinically significant changes from baseline in these variables. These analyses revealed no clinically important changes in laboratory test parameters associated with citalopram HBr treatment. ECG Changes Electrocardiograms from citalopram HBr (N=802) and placebo (N=241) groups were compared with respect to (1) mean change from baseline in various ECG parameters, and (2) the incidence of patients meeting criteria for potentially clinically significant changes from baseline in these variables. The only statistically significant drug-placebo difference observed was a decrease in heart rate for citalopram HBr of 1.7 bpm compared to no change in heart rate for placebo. There were no observed differences in QT or other ECG intervals. Other Events Observed During the Premarketing Evaluation of Citalopram HBr Following is a list of WHO terms that reflect treatment-emergent adverse events, as defined in the introduction to the ADVERSE REACTIONS section, reported by patients treated with citalo", "chunk_type": "adverse_reactions_0", "record_id": "75fc31e7-8d28-4296-8a73-a17f0d872c67", "section": "adverse_reactions", "similarity_score": 0.765478253364563}, {"content": "pine (N=532) Placebo (N=294) Body as a Whole Accidental injury 12 8 Asthenia 10 9 Fever 6 2 Back pain 5 2 Chest pain 3 1 Cardiovascular System Postural hypotension 3 1 Tachycardia 3 1 Hypertension 2 1 Digestive System Dry mouth 9 5 Constipation 9 4 Dyspepsia 7 5 Vomiting 4 3 Increased appetite 3 2 Hemic and Lymphatic System Ecchymosis 5 3 Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders Weight gain 5 3 Peripheral edema 3 1 Musculoskeletal System Extremity pain (other than joint) 5 3 Joint pain 5 3 Nervous System Somnolence 29 13 Insomnia 12 11 Dizziness 11 4 Abnormal gait 6 1 Tremor 4 3 Akathisia 3 2 Hypertonia 3 2 Articulation impairment 2 1 Respiratory System Rhinitis 7 6 Cough increased 6 3 Pharyngitis 4 3 Special Senses Amblyopia 3 2 Urogenital System Urinary incontinence 2 1 Urinary tract infection 2 1 Dose Dependency of Adverse Reactions A dose group difference has been observed for fatigue, dizziness, weight gain and prolactin elevation. In a single 8-week randomized, double-blind, fixed-dose study comparing 10 mg/day (N=199), 20 mg/day (N=200) and 40 mg/day (N=200) of oral olanzapine in adult patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, incidence of fatigue (10 mg/day: 1.5%; 20 mg/day: 2.1%; 40 mg/day: 6.6%) was observed with significant differences between 10 mg/day vs 40 mg/day and 20 mg/day vs 40 mg/day. The incidence of dizziness (10 mg/day: 2.6%; 20 mg/day: 1.6%; 40 mg/day: 6.6%) was observed with significant differences between 20 mg vs 40 mg. Dose group differences were also noted for weight gain and prolactin elevation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 , 5.15 )] . The following table addresses dose relatedness for other adverse reactions using data from a schizophrenia trial involving fixed dosage ranges of oral olanzapine. It enumerates the percentage of patients with treatment-emergent adverse reactions for the 3 fixed-dose range groups and placebo. The data were analyzed using the Cochran-Armitage test, excluding the placebo group, and the table includes only those adverse reactions for which there was a trend.

Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, the frequency and severity are greater with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. In general, an elevated risk of acute dystonia may be observed in males and younger age groups receiving antipsychotics; however, events of dystonia have been reported infrequently (<1%) with olanzapine use. Other Adverse Reactions Other Adverse Reactions Observed During the Clinical Trial Evaluation of Oral Olanzapine Following is a list of treatment-emergent adverse reactions reported by patients treated with oral olanzapine (at multiple doses \u22651 mg/day) in clinical trials. This listing is not intended to include reactions (1) already listed in previous tables or elsewhere in labeling, (2) for which a drug cause was remote, (3) which were so general as to be uninformative, (4) which were not considered to have significant clinical implications, or (5) which occurred at a rate equal to or less than placebo.

Other Events Observed During the Postmarketing Evaluation of Citalopram HBr It is estimated that over 30 million patients have been treated with citalopram since market introduction. Although no causal relationship to citalopram treatment has been found, the following adverse events have been reported to be temporally associated with citalopram treatment, and have not been described elsewhere in labeling: acute renal failure, akathisia, allergic reaction, anaphylaxis, angioedema, choreoathetosis, chest pain, delirium, dyskinesia, ecchymosis, epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, glaucoma, grand mal convulsions, hemolytic anemia, hepatic necrosis, myoclonus, nystagmus, pancreatitis, priapism, prolactinemia, prothrombin decreased, QT prolonged, rhabdomyolysis, spontaneous abortion, thrombocytopenia, thrombosis, ventricular arrhythmia, torsade de pointes, and withdrawal syndrome. DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE Controlled Substance Class Citalopram HBr is not a controlled substance. Physical and Psychological Dependence Animal studies suggest that the abuse liability of citalopram is low. Citalopram has not been systematically studied in humans for its potential for abuse, tolerance, or physical dependence. The premarketing clinical experience with citalopram did not reveal any drug-seeking behavior. However, these observations were not systematic and it is not possible to predict, on the basis of this limited experience, the extent to which a CNS-active drug will be misused, diverted, and/or abused once marketed. Consequently, physicians should carefully evaluate citalopram patients for history of drug abuse and follow such patients closely, observing them for signs of misuse or abuse (e.g., development of tolerance, incrementations of dose, drug-seeking behavior).

Adverse events following the abrupt discontinuation of gabapentin have also been reported. The most frequently reported events were anxiety, insomnia, nausea, pain and sweating.", "chunk_type": "adverse_reactions_1", "record_id": "29c0c23b-f87d-4a94-a411-4091f399ecd1", "section": "adverse_reactions", "similarity_score": 0.7598322033882141}, {"content": "tions (8.6) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.8 Rhabdomyolysis In the clinical development program for immediate-release pramipexole tablets, a single case of rhabdomyolysis occurred in a 49 year old male with advanced Parkinson's disease. The patient was hospitalized with an elevated CPK (10,631 IU/L). The symptoms resolved with discontinuation of the medication. Advise patients to contact a physician if they experience any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, as these may be symptoms of rhabdomyolysis. 5.9 Retinal Pathology Human Data A two-year open-label, randomized, parallel-group safety study of retinal deterioration and vision compared immediate-release pramipexole tablets and immediate-release ropinirole. Two hundred thirty four Parkinson\u2019s disease patients (115 on pramipexole, mean dose 3 mg/day and 119 on ropinirole, mean dose 9.5 mg/day) were evaluated using a panel of clinical ophthalmological assessments. Of 234 patients who were evaluable, 196 had been treated for two years and 29 were judged to have developed clinical abnormalities that were considered meaningful (19 patients in each treatment arm had received treatment for less than two years). There was no statistical difference in retinal deterioration between the treatment arms; however, the study was only capable of detecting a very large difference between treatments. In addition, because the study did not include an untreated comparison group (placebo treated), it is unknown whether the findings reported in patients treated with either drug are greater than the background rate in an aging population. Animal Data Pathologic changes (degeneration and loss of photoreceptor cells) were observed in the retina of albino rats in a 2 year carcinogenicity study. While retinal degeneration was not diagnosed in pigmented rats treated for 2 years, a thinning in the outer nuclear layer of the retina was slightly greater in rats given drug compared with controls. Evaluation of the retinas of albino mice, monkeys, and minipigs did not reveal similar changes. The potential significance of this effect for humans has not been established, but cannot be disregarded because disruption of a mechanism that is universally present in vertebrates (i.e., disk shedding) may be involved [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2) ]. 5.10 Events Reported with Dopaminergic Therapy Although the events enumerated below may not have been reported with the use of pramipexole in its development program, they are associated with the use of other dopaminergic drugs. The expected incidence of these events, however, is so low that even if pramipexole caused these events at rates similar to those attributable to other dopaminergic therapies, it would be unlikely that even a single case would have occurred in a cohort of the size exposed to pramipexole in studies to date. Hyperpyrexia and Confusion Although not reported with pramipexole in the clinical development program, a symptom complex resembling the neuroleptic malignant syndrome (characterized by elevated temperature, muscular rigidity, altered consciousness, and autonomic instability), with no other obvious etiology, has been reported in association with rapid dose reduction, withdrawal of, or changes in dopaminergic therapy. If possible, avoid sudden discontinuation or rapid dose reduction in patients taking pramipexole dihydrochloride extended-release tablets. If the decision is made to discontinue pramipexole dihydrochloride extended-release tablets, the dose should be tapered to reduce the risk of hyperpyrexia and confusion [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ]. Fibrotic Complications Cases of retroperitoneal fibrosis, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusion, pleural thickening, pericarditis, and cardiac valvulopathy have been reported in patients treated with ergot-derived dopaminergic agents. While these complications may resolve when the drug is discontinued, complete resolution does not always occur. Although these adverse events are believed to be related to the ergoline structure of these compounds, whether other, non-ergot derived dopamine agonists can cause them is unknown. Cases of possible fibrotic complications, including peritoneal fibrosis, pleural fibrosis, and pulmonary fibrosis have been reported in the postmarketing experience with immediate-release pramipexole tablets. While the evidence is not sufficient to establish a causal relationship between pramipexole and these fibrotic complications, a contribution of pramipexole cannot be completely ruled out. 5.11 Withdrawal Symptoms Symptoms including apathy, anxiety, depression, fatigue, insomnia, sweating, and pain have been reported during taper or after discontinuation of dopamine agonists, including pramipexole dihydrochloride extended-release tablets. These symptoms generally do not respond to levodopa. Prior to discontinuation of pramipexole dihydrochloride extended-release tablets, patients should be informed about potential withdrawal symptoms, and monitored during and after discontinuation. In case of severe withdrawal symptoms, a trial re-administration of a dopamine agonist at the lowest effective dose may be considered.", "chunk_type": "warnings_1", "record_id": "4dfe5cc9-1281-c6dc-a6dc-6113fd0aed67", "section": "warnings", "similarity_score": 0.7585850954055786}]}, "What is the average duration of follow up for TPAA studies?": {"success": true, "answer": "**Executive Summary**\n\nThe average duration of follow-up for TPAA studies is not explicitly detailed in the provided FDA regulatory data. However, the data includes information on clinical trials with follow-up periods ranging from 24 weeks to 12 months, depending on the study design and patient population. Key findings indicate consistent safety profiles across different patient groups and treatment durations.\n\n**Detailed Analysis**\n\nThe FDA regulatory data provided does not specify the average duration of follow-up for TPAA studies directly. However, it includes details on clinical trials with varying follow-up periods. For instance, in the study WA25204 involving tocilizumab, the controlled clinical trials had a follow-up period of 24 weeks [FDA_ID: 3090c1e0-c37b-d376-e063-6294a90a1cab]. Another study involving giant cell arteritis patients had a follow-up of 12 months during the double-blind, placebo-controlled phase [FDA_ID: 3090c1e0-c37b-d376-e063-6294a90a1cab].\n\n**Regulatory Characteristics**\n\n- **Drug Approvals and Labeling**: Tocilizumab has been approved for various indications, including rheumatoid arthritis and giant cell arteritis, with specific labeling requirements for each condition.\n- **Safety Profiles**: The safety profile of tocilizumab is consistent across different studies, with common adverse reactions including infections and elevated liver enzymes.\n- **Adverse Event Patterns**: The incidence of adverse events such as infections and infusion reactions is documented, with variations based on patient weight and dosage [FDA_ID: 3090c1e0-c37b-d376-e063-6294a90a1cab].\n\n**Key Findings and Patterns**\n\n- **Trends**: The data shows a consistent safety profile for tocilizumab across different patient populations and study durations. The incidence of adverse events such as infections and elevated liver enzymes is a common finding.\n- **Regulatory Approaches**: The studies follow rigorous regulatory pathways, with detailed documentation of adverse events and safety monitoring.\n\n**Safety and Compliance Implications**\n\n- **Healthcare Providers**: Should be aware of the consistent safety profile of tocilizumab and monitor patients for common adverse events such as infections and liver enzyme elevations.\n- **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensuring adherence to labeling requirements and monitoring for adverse events is crucial for compliance with FDA regulations.\n- **Safety Monitoring**: Ongoing post-market surveillance is essential to detect any new safety signals and ensure patient safety.\n\n**Data Limitations**\n\n- **Information Gaps**: The specific average duration of follow-up for TPAA studies is not detailed in the provided data. Additional regulatory data or monitoring might be needed to obtain this information.\n- **Need for Further Monitoring**: Continuous safety monitoring and reporting of adverse events are necessary to maintain an up-to-date safety profile for tocilizumab.\n\nIn summary, while the average duration of follow-up for TPAA studies is not explicitly provided, the available data highlights consistent safety profiles and regulatory compliance across various clinical trials involving tocilizumab.", "citations": ["3090c1e0-c37b-d376-e063-6294a90a1cab", "187a99bd-1c9b-8eaf-e063-6394a90a2a74", "002da62b-aec3-8e2a-e063-6294a90a5efc", "037b0da7-6b6b-4cce-bb28-05597873a467", "3090c1e0-c37b-d376-e063-6294a90a1cab", "3090c1e0-c37b-d376-e063-6294a90a1cab", "f03590e9-03f4-42db-aa41-57ef3237a98c", "3090c1e0-c37b-d376-e063-6294a90a1cab", "0044f1d7-613c-4611-8481-13032c8cb390", "798ee083-7112-48a1-e053-2991aa0ad614"], "metadata": {"generation_time": 12.204103469848633, "openai_tokens": 3945}, "processing_time": 57.51513600349426, "records": [{"content": " ULN to 3\u00d7 ULN 36 33 45 48 23 > 3\u00d7 ULN to 5\u00d7 ULN 1 4 5 5 1 > 5\u00d7 ULN 0.7 1 1.3 1.5 0.3 In the all-exposure population, the elevations in ALT and AST remained consistent with what was seen in the 24 week, controlled clinical trials. In Study WA25204, of the 1538 patients with moderate to severe RA [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] and treated with tocilizumab, elevations in ALT or AST >3 \u00d7 ULN occurred in 5.3% and 2.2% patients, respectively. One serious event of drug induced hepatitis with hyperbilirubinemia was reported in association with tocilizumab. Lipids Elevations in lipid parameters (total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides) were first assessed at 6 weeks following initiation of tocilizumab-IV in the controlled 24 week clinical trials. Increases were observed at this time point and remained stable thereafter. Increases in triglycerides to levels above 500 mg per dL were rarely observed. Changes in other lipid parameters from baseline to week 24 were evaluated and are summarized below: Mean LDL increased by 13 mg per dL in the tocilizumab 4 mg per kg+DMARD arm, 20 mg per dL in the tocilizumab 8 mg per kg+DMARD, and 25 mg per dL in tocilizumab 8 mg per kg monotherapy. Mean HDL increased by 3 mg per dL in the tocilizumab 4 mg per kg+DMARD arm, 5 mg per dL in the tocilizumab 8 mg per kg+DMARD, and 4 mg per dL in tocilizumab 8 mg per kg monotherapy. Mean LDL/HDL ratio increased by an average of 0.14 in the tocilizumab 4 mg per kg+DMARD arm, 0.15 in the tocilizumab 8 mg per kg+DMARD, and 0.26 in tocilizumab 8 mg per kg monotherapy. ApoB/ApoA1 ratios were essentially unchanged in tocilizumab-treated patients. Elevated lipids responded to lipid lowering agents. In the all-exposure population, the elevations in lipid parameters remained consistent with what was seen in the 24 week, controlled clinical trials. Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of tocilizumab or of other tocilizumab products. In the 24 week, controlled clinical studies, a total of 2876 patients have been tested for anti-tocilizumab antibodies. Forty-six patients (2%) developed positive anti-tocilizumab antibodies, of whom 5 had an associated, medically significant, hypersensitivity reaction leading to withdrawal. Thirty patients (1%) developed neutralizing antibodies. Malignancies During the 24 week, controlled period of the studies, 15 malignancies were diagnosed in patients receiving tocilizumab-IV, compared to 8 malignancies in patients in the control groups. Exposure-adjusted incidence was similar in the tocilizumab-IV groups (1.32 events per 100 patient-years) and in the placebo plus DMARD group (1.37 events per 100 patient-years). In the all-exposure population, the rate of malignancies remained consistent with the rate observed in the 24 week, controlled period [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Other Adverse Reactions Adverse reactions occurring in 2% or more of patients on 4 or 8 mg per kg tocilizumab-IV plus DMARD and at least 1% greater than that observed in patients on placebo plus DMARD are summarized in Table 2 .

Patients received tocilizumab 7 mg/kg every 4 weeks for 20 weeks, followed by 6 mg/kg every 4 weeks for 20 weeks. The total patient years exposure to treatment was 17.5 years. The safety of tocilizumab by another route of administration has been studied in one Phase III study with 251 GCA patients. The total patient years duration was 138.5 patient years during the 12-month double blind, placebo-controlled phase of the study. The overall safety profile observed was generally consistent with the known safety profile of tocilizumab. There was an overall higher incidence of infections in GCA patients relative to RA patients. The overall safety profile observed for tocilizumab administered intravenously in GCA patients was consistent with the known safety profile of tocilizumab. 6.3 Clinical Trials Experience in Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis Patients Treated with Intravenous Tocilizumab (Tocilizumab-IV) The safety of tocilizumab-IV was studied in 188 pediatric patients 2 to 17 years of age with PJIA who had an inadequate clinical response or were intolerant to methotrexate. The total patient exposure in the tocilizumab-IV all exposure population (defined as patients who received at least one dose of tocilizumab-IV) was 184.4 patient years. At baseline, approximately half of the patients were taking oral corticosteroids and almost 80% were taking methotrexate. In general, the types of adverse drug reactions in patients with PJIA were consistent with those seen in RA and SJIA patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 and 6.4) ]. Infections The rate of infections in the tocilizumab-IV all exposure population was 163.7 per 100 patient years. The most common events observed were nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infections. The rate of serious infections was numerically higher in patients weighing less than 30 kg treated with 10 mg/kg tocilizumab (12.2 per 100 patient years) compared to patients weighing at or above 30 kg, treated with 8 mg/kg tocilizumab (4.0 per 100 patient years). The incidence of infections leading to dose interruptions was also numerically higher in patients weighing less than 30 kg treated with 10 mg/kg tocilizumab (21%) compared to patients weighing at or above 30 kg, treated with 8 mg/kg tocilizumab (8%). Infusion Reactions In PJIA patients, infusion-related reactions are defined as all events occurring during or within 24 hours of an infusion. In the tocilizumab-IV all exposure population, 11 patients (6%) experienced an event during the infusion, and 38 patients (20.2%) experienced an event within 24 hours of an infusion. The most common events occurring during infusion were headache, nausea and hypotension, and occurring within 24 hours of infusion were dizziness and hypotension. In general, the adverse drug reactions observed during or within 24 hours of an infusion were similar in nature to those seen in RA and SJIA patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 and 6.4) ]. No clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions associated with tocilizumab and requiring treatment discontinuation were reported. Immunogenicity One patient, in the 10 mg/kg less than 30 kg group, developed positive anti-tocilizumab antibodies without developing a hypersensitivity reaction and subsequently withdrew from the study. Laboratory Abnormalities Neutropenia During routine laboratory monitoring in the tocilizumab-IV all exposure population, a decrease in neutrophil counts below 1 \u00d7 10 9 per L occurred in 3.7% of patients. There was no clear relationship between decreases in neutrophils below 1 \u00d7 10 9 per L and the occurrence of serious infections. Thrombocytopenia During routine laboratory monitoring in the tocilizumab-IV all exposure population, 1% of patients had a decrease in platelet count at or less than 50,000 per mm 3 without associated bleeding events. Elevated Liver Enzymes During routine laboratory monitoring in the tocilizumab-IV all exposure population, elevation in ALT or AST at or greater than 3 \u00d7 ULN occurred in 4% and less than 1% of patients, respectively. Lipids During routine laboratory monitoring in the tocilizumab all exposure population, elevation in total cholesterol greater than 1.5-2 \u00d7 ULN occurred in one patient (0.5%) and elevation in LDL greater than 1.5-2 \u00d7 ULN occurred in one patient (0.5%). 6.4 Clinical Trials Experience in Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis Patients Treated with Intravenous Tocilizumab (Tocilizumab-IV) The data described below reflect exposure to tocilizumab-IV in one randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 112 pediatric patients with SJIA 2 to 17 years of age who had an inadequate clinical response to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or corticosteroids due to toxicity or lack of efficacy. At baseline, approximately half of the patients were taking 0.3 mg/kg/day corticosteroids or more, and almost 70% were taking methotrexate.

Adverse Reactions from Treatment and Prophylaxis Trials in Adult and Adolescent Subjects (13 years of age and older) The overall safety profile of oseltamivir phosphate for oral suspension is based on data from 2,646 adult and adolescent subjects that received the recommended dosage of 75 mg orally twice daily for 5 days for treatment of influenza and 1,943 adult and adolescent subjects that received the recommended dosage of 75 mg orally once daily for up to 6 weeks for prophylaxis of influenza in clinical trials. The most common adverse reactions in the pooled treatment and pooled prophylaxis trials in adults and adolescents are displayed in Table 5 . The majority of these adverse reactions were reported on a single occasion, occurred on either the first or second treatment day and resolved spontaneously within 1-2 days. This summary includes otherwise healthy adults/adolescents and subjects \"at risk\" (subjects at higher risk of developing complications associated with influenza, e.g., elderly patients and patients with chronic cardiac or respiratory disease). In general, the safety profile in the subjects \"at risk\" was qualitatively similar to that in otherwise healthy adults/adolescents. Table 5 Adverse Reactions Occurring in \u22651% of Adults and Adolescents (13 years of age and older) in Treatment and Prophylaxis Trials Adverse reactions that occurred in \u22651% of oseltamivir phosphate -treated adults and adolescents and \u22651% greater in oseltamivir phosphate-treated subjects compared to placebo-treated subjects in either the treatment or prophylaxis trials.

A total of 859 pediatric subjects received treatment with oseltamivir phosphate for oral suspension either at a 2 mg per kg twice daily for 5 days or weight-band dosing. Vomiting was the only adverse reaction reported at a frequency of > 1% in subjects receiving oseltamivir phosphate (16%) compared to placebo (8%). Amongst the 148 pediatric subjects aged 1 year to 12 years who received oseltamivir phosphate at doses of 30 to 60 mg once daily for 10 days in a post-exposure prophylaxis study in household contacts (n = 99), and in a separate 6\u2013week seasonal influenza prophylaxis safety study (n = 49), vomiting was the most frequent adverse reaction (8% on oseltamivir phosphate versus 2% in the no prophylaxis group). Adverse Reactions from Treatment Trials in Pediatric Subjects (2 weeks to less than 1 year of age) Assessment of adverse reactions in pediatric subjects 2 weeks to less than 1 year of age was based on two open\u2010label studies that included safety data on 135 influenza\u2010infected subjects 2 weeks to less than 1 year of age (including premature infants at least 36 weeks post conceptional age) exposed to oseltamivir phosphate at doses ranging from 2 to 3.5 mg per kg of the formulation for oral suspension twice daily orally for 5 days. The safety profile of oseltamivir phosphate was similar across the age range studied, with vomiting (9%), diarrhea (7%) and diaper rash (7%) being the most frequently reported adverse reactions, and was generally comparable to that observed in older pediatric and adult subjects. Adverse Reactions from the Prophylaxis Trial in Immunocompromised Subjects In a 12-week seasonal prophylaxis study in 475 immunocompromised subjects, including 18 pediatric subjects 1 year to 12 years of age, the safety profile in the 238 subjects receiving oseltamivir phosphate 75 mg once daily was consistent with that previously observed in other oseltamivir phosphate prophylaxis clinical trials [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of oseltamivir phosphate. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to oseltamivir phosphate exposure.

Mean increases in blood glucose have been observed in patients treated (median exposure of 9.2 months) with olanzapine in phase 1 of the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE). The mean increase of serum glucose (fasting and nonfasting samples) from baseline to the average of the 2 highest serum concentrations was 15.0 mg/dL. In a study of healthy volunteers, subjects who received olanzapine (N=22) for 3 weeks had a mean increase compared to baseline in fasting blood glucose of 2.3 mg/dL. Placebo-treated subjects (N=19) had a mean increase in fasting blood glucose compared to baseline of 0.34 mg/dL. Olanzapine Monotherapy in Adults \u2014 In an analysis of 5 placebo-controlled adult olanzapine monotherapy studies with a median treatment duration of approximately 3 weeks, olanzapine was associated with a greater mean change in fasting glucose levels compared to placebo (2.76 mg/dL versus 0.17 mg/dL). The difference in mean changes between olanzapine and placebo was greater in patients with evidence of glucose dysregulation at baseline (patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus or related adverse reactions, patients treated with anti-diabetic agents, patients with a baseline random glucose level \u2265200 mg/dL, and/or a baseline fasting glucose level \u2265126 mg/dL). Olanzapine-treated patients had a greater mean HbA 1c increase from baseline of 0.04% (median exposure 21 days), compared to a mean HbA 1c decrease of 0.06% in placebo-treated subjects (median exposure 17 days). In an analysis of 8 placebo-controlled studies (median treatment exposure 4-5 weeks), 6.1% of olanzapine-treated subjects (N=855) had treatment-emergent glycosuria compared to 2.8% of placebo-treated subjects (N=599).

Olanzapine Monotherapy in Adolescents \u2014 The safety and efficacy of olanzapine have not been established in patients under the age of 13 years. In an analysis of 3 placebo-controlled olanzapine monotherapy studies of adolescent patients, including those with schizophrenia (6 weeks) or bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes) (3 weeks), olanzapine was associated with a greater mean change from baseline in fasting glucose levels compared to placebo (2.68 mg/dL versus -2.59 mg/dL).

Modest mean increases in total cholesterol have also been seen with olanzapine use. Olanzapine Monotherapy in Adults \u2014 In an analysis of 5 placebo-controlled olanzapine monotherapy studies with treatment duration up to 12 weeks, olanzapine-treated patients had increases from baseline in mean fasting total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides of 5.3 mg/dL, 3.0 mg/dL, and 20.8 mg/dL respectively compared to decreases from baseline in mean fasting total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides of 6.1 mg/dL, 4.3 mg/dL, and 10.7 mg/dL for placebo-treated patients. For fasting HDL cholesterol, no clinically meaningful differences were observed between olanzapine-treated patients and placebo-treated patients. Mean increases in fasting lipid values (total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides) were greater in patients without evidence of lipid dysregulation at baseline, where lipid dysregulation was defined as patients diagnosed with dyslipidemia or related adverse reactions, patients treated with lipid lowering agents, or patients with high baseline lipid levels. In long-term studies (at least 48 weeks), patients had increases from baseline in mean fasting total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides of 5.6 mg/dL, 2.5 mg/dL, and 18.7 mg/dL, respectively, and a mean decrease in fasting HDL cholesterol of 0.16 mg/dL. In an analysis of patients who completed 12 months of therapy, the mean nonfasting total cholesterol did not increase further after approximately 4-6 months. The proportion of patients who had changes (at least once) in total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol or triglycerides from normal or borderline to high, or changes in HDL cholesterol from normal or borderline to low, was greater in long-term studies (at least 48 weeks) as compared with short-term studies.

Olanzapine Monotherapy in Adolescents \u2014 The safety and efficacy of olanzapine have not been established in patients under the age of 13 years. In an analysis of 3 placebo-controlled olanzapine monotherapy studies of adolescents, including those with schizophrenia (6 weeks) or bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes) (3 weeks), olanzapine-treated adolescents had increases from baseline in mean fasting total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides of 12.9 mg/dL, 6.5 mg/dL, and 28.4 mg/dL, respectively, compared to increases from baseline in mean fasting total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol of 1.3 mg/dL and 1.0 mg/dL, and a decrease in triglycerides of 1.1 mg/dL for placebo-treated adolescents. For fasting HDL cholesterol, no clinically meaningful differences were observed between olanzapine-treated adolescents and placebo-treated adolescents. In long-term studies (at least 24 weeks), adolescents had increases from baseline in mean fasting total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides of 5.5 mg/dL, 5.4 mg/dL, and 20.5 mg/dL, respectively, and a mean decrease in fasting HDL cholesterol of 4.5 mg/dL.

Monitor neutrophils, platelets, ALT and AST at the time of the second administration and thereafter every 4 to 8 weeks for PJIA and every 2 to 4 weeks for SJIA. Monitor lipids as above for approved adult indications [see Dosage and Administration (2.8) ]. 5.5 Immunosuppression The impact of treatment with tocilizumab products on the development of malignancies is not known but malignancies were observed in clinical studies [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. TOFIDENCE is an immunosuppressant, and treatment with immunosuppressants may result in an increased risk of malignancies. 5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions, Including Anaphylaxis Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported in association with tocilizumab products and anaphylactic events with a fatal outcome have been reported with intravenous infusion of tocilizumab products. Anaphylaxis and other hypersensitivity reactions that required treatment discontinuation were reported in 0.1% (3 out of 2644) of patients in the 6-month controlled trials of intravenous tocilizumab and 0.2% (8 out of 4009) of patients in the intravenous all-exposure RA population. In the SJIA controlled trial with intravenous tocilizumab, 1 out of 112 patients (0.9%) experienced hypersensitivity reactions that required treatment discontinuation. In the PJIA controlled trial with intravenous tocilizumab 0 out of 188 patients (0%) in the tocilizumab all-exposure population experienced hypersensitivity reactions that required treatment discontinuation. Reactions that required treatment discontinuation included generalized erythema, rash, and urticaria. In the postmarketing setting, events of hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and death have occurred in patients treated with a range of doses of intravenous tocilizumab products, with or without concomitant therapies. Events have occurred in patients who received premedication. Hypersensitivity, including anaphylaxis events, have occurred both with and without previous hypersensitivity reactions and as early as the first infusion of tocilizumab products [see Adverse Reactions (6.6) ]. In addition, serious cutaneous reactions, including Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), have been reported in patients with autoinflammatory conditions treated with tocilizumab products. TOFIDENCE for intravenous use should only be infused by a healthcare professional with appropriate medical support to manage anaphylaxis. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, immediately discontinue TOFIDENCE, treat promptly and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve. 5.7 Demyelinating Disorders The impact of treatment with tocilizumab products on demyelinating disorders is not known, but multiple sclerosis and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy were reported rarely in RA clinical studies. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms potentially indicative of demyelinating disorders. Prescribers should exercise caution in considering the use of TOFIDENCE in patients with preexisting or recent onset demyelinating disorders. 5.8 Active Hepatic Disease and Hepatic Impairment Treatment with TOFIDENCE is not recommended in patients with active hepatic disease or hepatic impairment [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. 5.9 Vaccinations Avoid use of live vaccines concurrently with TOFIDENCE as clinical safety has not been established. No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection from persons receiving live vaccines to patients receiving tocilizumab products. No data are available on the effectiveness of vaccination in patients receiving tocilizumab products. Because IL-6 inhibition may interfere with the normal immune response to new antigens, it is recommended that all patients, particularly pediatric or elderly patients, if possible, be brought up to date with all immunizations in agreement with current immunization guidelines prior to initiating TOFIDENCE therapy. The interval between live vaccinations and initiation of TOFIDENCE therapy should be in accordance with current vaccination guidelines regarding immunosuppressive agents.", "chunk_type": "warnings_1", "record_id": "3090c1e0-c37b-d376-e063-6294a90a1cab", "section": "warnings", "similarity_score": 0.7514448165893555}, {"content": "tric patients with SJIA 2 to 17 years of age who had an inadequate clinical response to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or corticosteroids due to toxicity or lack of efficacy. At baseline, approximately half of the patients were taking 0.3 mg/kg/day corticosteroids or more, and almost 70% were taking methotrexate. The trial included a 12 week controlled phase followed by an open-label extension. In the 12 week double-blind, controlled portion of the clinical study 75 patients received treatment with tocilizumab-IV (8 or 12 mg per kg based upon body weight). After 12 weeks or at the time of escape, due to disease worsening, patients were treated with tocilizumab-IV in the open-label extension phase. The most common adverse events (at least 5%) seen in tocilizumab-IV treated patients in the 12 week controlled portion of the study were: upper respiratory tract infection, headache, nasopharyngitis and diarrhea. Infections In the 12 week controlled phase, the rate of all infections in the tocilizumab-IV group was 345 per 100 patient-years and 287 per 100 patient-years in the placebo group. In the open label extension over an average duration of 73 weeks of treatment, the overall rate of infections was 304 per 100 patient-years. In the 12 week controlled phase, the rate of serious infections in the tocilizumab-IV group was 11.5 per 100 patient years. In the open label extension over an average duration of 73 weeks of treatment, the overall rate of serious infections was 11.4 per 100 patient years. The most commonly reported serious infections included pneumonia, gastroenteritis, varicella, and otitis media. Macrophage Activation Syndrome In the 12 week controlled study, no patient in any treatment group experienced macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) while on assigned treatment; 3 per 112 (3%) developed MAS during open-label treatment with tocilizumab-IV. One patient in the placebo group escaped to tocilizumab-IV 12 mg per kg at Week 2 due to severe disease activity, and ultimately developed MAS at Day 70. Two additional patients developed MAS during the long-term extension. All 3 patients had tocilizumab-IV dose interrupted (2 patients) or discontinued (1 patient) for the MAS event, received treatment, and the MAS resolved without sequelae. Based on a limited number of cases, the incidence of MAS does not appear to be elevated in the tocilizumab-IV SJIA clinical development experience; however no definitive conclusions can be made. Infusion Reactions Patients were not premedicated, however most patients were on concomitant corticosteroids as part of their background treatment for SJIA. Infusion related reactions were defined as all events occurring during or within 24 hours after an infusion. In the 12 week controlled phase, 4% of tocilizumab-IV and 0% of placebo treated patients experienced events occurring during infusion. One event (angioedema) was considered serious and life-threatening, and the patient was discontinued from study treatment. Within 24 hours after infusion, 16% of patients in the tocilizumab-IV treatment group and 5% of patients in the placebo group experienced an event. In the tocilizumab-IV group the events included rash, urticaria, diarrhea, epigastric discomfort, arthralgia and headache. One of these events, urticaria, was considered serious. Anaphylaxis Anaphylaxis was reported in 1 out of 112 patients (less than 1%) treated with tocilizumab-IV during the controlled and open label extension study [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. Immunogenicity All 112 patients were tested for anti-tocilizumab antibodies at baseline. Two patients developed positive anti-tocilizumab antibodies: one of these patients experienced serious adverse events of urticaria and angioedema consistent with an anaphylactic reaction which led to withdrawal; the other patient developed macrophage activation syndrome while on escape therapy and was discontinued from the study. Laboratory Abnormalities Neutropenia During routine monitoring in the 12 week controlled phase, a decrease in neutrophil below 1 \u00d7 10 9 per L occurred in 7% of patients in the tocilizumab-IV group, and in no patients in the placebo group. In the open label extension over an average duration of 73 weeks of treatment, a decreased neutrophil count occurred in 17% of the tocilizumab-IV group. There was no clear relationship between decrease in neutrophils below 1 \u00d7 10 9 per L and the occurrence of serious infections. Thrombocytopenia During routine monitoring in the 12 week controlled phase, 1% of patients in the tocilizumab-IV group and 3% in the placebo group had a decrease in platelet count to no more than 100,000 per mm 3 . In the open label extension over an average duration of 73 weeks of treatment, decreased platelet count occurred in 4% of patients in the tocilizumab-IV group, with no associated bleeding. Elevated Liver Enzymes During routine laboratory monitoring in the 12 week controlled phase, elevation in ALT or AST at or above 3\u00d7 ULN occurred in 5% and 3% of patients, respectively in the tocilizumab-IV group and in 0% of placebo patients. In the open label extension over an average duration of 73 weeks of treatment, the elevation in ALT or AST at or above 3\u00d7 ULN occurred in 13% and 5% of tocilizumab-IV treated patients, respectively. Lipids During routine laboratory monitoring in the 12 week controlled phase, elevation in total cholesterol greater than 1.5\u00d7 ULN \u2013 2\u00d7 ULN occurred in 1.5% of the tocilizumab-IV group and in 0% of placebo patients. Elevation in LDL greater than 1.5\u00d7 ULN \u2013 2\u00d7 ULN occurred in 1.9% of patients in the tocilizumab-IV group and 0% of the placebo group. In the open label extension study over an average duration of 73 weeks of treatment, the pattern and incidence of elevations in lipid parameters remained consistent with the 12 week controlled study data. 6.5 Clinical Trials Experience in COVID-19 Patients Treated with Intravenous Tocilizumab (Tocilizumab-IV) The safety of tocilizumab in hospitalized COVID-19 patients was evaluated in a pooled safety population that includes patients enrolled in EMPACTA, COVACTA, AND REMDACTA. The analysis of adverse reactions included a total of 974 patients exposed to tocilizumab. Patients received a single, 60-minute infusion of intravenous tocilizumab 8 mg/kg (maximum dose of 800 mg). If clinical signs or symptoms worsened or did not improve, one additional dose of tocilizumab 8 mg/kg could be administered between 8- 24 hours after the initial dose. Adverse reactions summarized in Table 3 occurred in at least 3% of tocilizumab -treated patients and more commonly than in patients on placebo in the pooled safety population. Table 3 Adverse Reactions Patients are counted once for each category regardless of the number of reactions Identified From the Pooled COVID-19 Safety Population Adverse Reaction Tocilizumab 8mg per kg Placebo N = 974 (%) N = 483 (%) Hepatic Transaminases increased 10% 8% Constipation 9% 8% Urinary tract infection 5% 4% Hypertension 4% 1% Hypokalaemia 4% 3% Anxiety 4% 2% Diarrhea 4% 2% Insomnia 4% 3% Nausea 3% 2% In the pooled safety population, the rates of infection/serious infection events were 30%/19% in patients receiving tocilizumab versus 32%/23% receiving placebo. Laboratory Abnormalities In the pooled safety population of EMPACTA, COVACTA, and REMDACTA, neutrophil counts <1000 cells/mcl occurred in 3.4% of patients who received tocilizumab and 0.5% of patients who received placebo. Platelet counts <50,000 cells/mcl occurred in 3.2% of patients who received tocilizumab and 1.5% of patients who received placebo. ALT or AST at or above 5\u00d7 ULN occurred in 11.7% of patients who received tocilizumab and 9.9% of patients who received placebo. 6.6 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tocilizumab products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hypersensitivity Reactions: Fatal anaphylaxis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Pancreatitis Drug-induced liver injury, Hepatitis, Hepatic failure, Jaundice [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]", "chunk_type": "adverse_reactions_2", "record_id": "3090c1e0-c37b-d376-e063-6294a90a1cab", "section": "adverse_reactions", "similarity_score": 0.7508273720741272}, {"content": "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: For refraction, instill one or two drops of 1% solution in the eye(s), repeated in five minutes.

In these studies, patients received doses of tocilizumab-IV 8 mg per kg monotherapy (288 patients), tocilizumab-IV 8 mg per kg in combination with DMARDs (including methotrexate) (1582 patients), or tocilizumab-IV 4 mg per kg in combination with methotrexate (774 patients). The all exposure population includes all patients in registration studies who received at least one dose of tocilizumab-IV. Of the 4009 patients in this population, 3577 received treatment for at least 6 months, 3309 for at least one year; 2954 received treatment for at least 2 years and 2189 for 3 years. All patients in these studies had moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis. The study population had a mean age of 52 years, 82% were female and 74% were Caucasian. The most common serious adverse reactions were serious infections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. The most commonly reported adverse reactions in controlled studies up to 24 weeks (occurring in at least 5% of patients treated with tocilizumab-IV monotherapy or in combination with DMARDs) were upper respiratory tract infections, nasopharyngitis, headache, hypertension and increased ALT. The proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to any adverse reactions during the double-blind, placebo-controlled studies was 5% for patients taking tocilizumab-IV and 3% for placebo-treated patients. The most common adverse reactions that required discontinuation of tocilizumab-IV were increased hepatic transaminase values (per protocol requirement) and serious infections. Overall Infections In the 24 week, controlled clinical studies, the rate of infections in the tocilizumab-IV monotherapy group was 119 events per 100 patient-years and was similar in the methotrexate monotherapy group. The rate of infections in the 4 mg per kg and 8 mg per kg tocilizumab-IV plus DMARD group was 133 and 127 events per 100 patient-years, respectively, compared to 112 events per 100 patient-years in the placebo plus DMARD group. The most commonly reported infections (5% to 8% of patients) were upper respiratory tract infections and nasopharyngitis. The overall rate of infections with tocilizumab-IV in the all exposure population remained consistent with rates in the controlled periods of the studies. Serious Infections In the 24 week, controlled clinical studies, the rate of serious infections in the tocilizumab-IV monotherapy group was 3.6 per 100 patient-years compared to 1.5 per 100 patient-years in the methotrexate group. The rate of serious infections in the 4 mg per kg and 8 mg per kg tocilizumab-IV plus DMARD group was 4.4 and 5.3 events per 100 patient-years, respectively, compared to 3.9 events per 100 patient-years in the placebo plus DMARD group. In the all-exposure population, the overall rate of serious infections remained consistent with rates in the controlled periods of the studies. The most common serious infections included pneumonia, urinary tract infection, cellulitis, herpes zoster, gastroenteritis, diverticulitis, sepsis and bacterial arthritis. Cases of opportunistic infections have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. In the cardiovascular outcomes Study WA25204, the rate of serious infections in the tocilizumab 8 mg/kg IV every 4 weeks group, with or without DMARD, was 4.5 per 100 patient-years, and the rate in the etanercept 50 mg weekly SC group, with or without DMARD, was 3.2 per 100 patient-years [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. Gastrointestinal Perforations During the 24 week, controlled clinical trials, the overall rate of gastrointestinal perforation was 0.26 events per 100 patient-years with tocilizumab-IV therapy. In the all-exposure population, the overall rate of gastrointestinal perforation remained consistent with rates in the controlled periods of the studies. Reports of gastrointestinal perforation were primarily reported as complications of diverticulitis including generalized purulent peritonitis, lower GI perforation, fistula and abscess. Most patients who developed gastrointestinal perforations were taking concomitant nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, or methotrexate [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. The relative contribution of these concomitant medications versus tocilizumab-IV to the development of GI perforations is not known. Infusion Reactions In the 24 week, controlled clinical studies, adverse events associated with the infusion (occurring during or within 24 hours of the start of infusion) were reported in 8% and 7% of patients in the 4 mg per kg and 8 mg per kg tocilizumab-IV plus DMARD group, respectively, compared to 5% of patients in the placebo plus DMARD group. The most frequently reported event on the 4 mg per kg and 8 mg per kg dose during the infusion was hypertension (1% for both doses), while the most frequently reported event occurring within 24 hours of finishing an infusion were headache (1% for both doses) and skin reactions (1% for both doses), including rash, pruritus and urticaria. These events were not treatment limiting. Anaphylaxis Hypersensitivity reactions requiring treatment discontinuation, including anaphylaxis, associated with tocilizumab-IV were reported in 0.1% (3 out of 2644) in the 24 week, controlled trials and in 0.2% (8 out of 4009) in the all-exposure population. These reactions were generally observed during the second to fourth infusion of tocilizumab-IV. Appropriate medical treatment should be available for immediate use in the event of a serious hypersensitivity reaction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. Laboratory Abnormalities Neutropenia In the 24 week, controlled clinical studies, decreases in neutrophil counts below 1000 per mm 3 occurred in 1.8% and 3.4% of patients in the 4 mg per kg and 8 mg per kg tocilizumab-IV plus DMARD group, respectively, compared to 0.1% of patients in the placebo plus DMARD group. Approximately half of the instances of ANC below 1000 per mm 3 occurred within 8 weeks of starting therapy. Decreases in neutrophil counts below 500 per mm 3 occurred in 0.4% and 0.3% of patients in the 4 mg per kg and 8 mg per kg tocilizumab-IV plus DMARD, respectively, compared to 0.1% of patients in the placebo plus DMARD group. There was no clear relationship between decreases in neutrophils below 1000 per mm 3 and the occurrence of serious infections. In the all-exposure population, the pattern and incidence of decreases in neutrophil counts remained consistent with what was seen in the 24 week controlled clinical studies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Thrombocytopenia In the 24 week, controlled clinical studies, decreases in platelet counts below 100,000 per mm 3 occurred in 1.3% and 1.7% of patients on 4 mg per kg and 8 mg per kg tocilizumab-IV plus DMARD, respectively, compared to 0.5% of patients on placebo plus DMARD, without associated bleeding events. In the all-exposure population, the pattern and incidence of decreases in platelet counts remained consistent with what was seen in the 24 week controlled clinical studies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Elevated Liver Enzymes Liver enzyme abnormalities are summarized in Table 1. In patients experiencing liver enzyme elevation, modification of treatment regimen, such as reduction in the dose of concomitant DMARD, interruption of tocilizumab-IV, or reduction in tocilizumab-IV dose, resulted in decrease or normalization of liver enzymes [see Dosage and Administration (2.8) ]. These elevations were not associated with clinically relevant increases in direct bilirubin, nor were they associated with clinical evidence of hepatitis or hepatic insufficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4) ].
