THE IFU CAUTIONS THAT THE SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS HAVE NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR PATIENTS WITH BULKY CALCIFIED AORTIC VALVE LEAFLETS IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO CORONARY OSTIA. CORONARY OCCLUSION CAN RESULT IN MYOCARDIAL ISCHEMIA OR INFARCTION DUE TO OBSTRUCTION OF THE CORONARY BLOOD FLOW AND MAY REQUIRE INTERVENTION (E.G. PCI). THERE ARE MULTIPLE PATIENT FACTORS THAT COULD CONTRIBUTE TO CORONARY OCCLUSION BY THE PROSTHETIC VALVE OR NATIVE VALVE LEAFLETS, INCLUDING A MINIMAL DISTANCE BETWEEN THE NATIVE ANNULUS AND THE CORONARY OSTIA, BULKY CALCIFICATION, LONG NATIVE LEAFLETS, AND OBLITERATED CORONARY SINUSES. PROCEDURAL FACTORS SUCH AS TORN NATIVE LEAFLET DURING BAV, PLAQUE SHIFT, DEPLOYMENT OF THE BIOPROSTHETIC HEART VALVE TOO AORTIC AND SIGNIFICANT VALVE OVER SIZING COULD ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO THIS COMPLICATION. THE EDWARDS THV TRAINING MANUALS ADVISE THE OPERATOR ON PRE-PROCEDURE ASSESSMENT OF THE AORTIC VALVE, ROOT, AND CORONARY ANATOMY. PHYSICIANS ARE EXTENSIVELY TRAINED BY EDWARDS BEFORE THEY ARE QUALIFIED TO USE THE TRANSCATHETER HEART VALVE (THV). TRAINING INCLUDES PATIENT SCREENING, DEVICE PREPARATION, APPROACH, DEPLOYMENT, IMAGING, PROCEDURE-SPECIFIC TRAINING MANUALS AND PROCTORED PROCEDURES. THE PHYSICIAN IS INSTRUCTED TO EVALUATE THIS RISK EARLY IN THE PATIENT SCREENING PROCESS IN ALL PATIENTS THE FOLLOWING FACTORS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED: DEGREE OF CALCIFICATION ON LEAFLETS, ANNULUS TO CORONARY OSTIA DISTANCE, LENGTH OF THE VALVE LEAFLET, WIDTH OF THE VALSALVA SINUSES, MOVEMENT OF THE LEAFLETS DURING BAV, PATENCY OF CORONARIES DURING BAV, AND EXPANDED HEIGHT OF THE INTENDED THV. THE TRAINING MANUALS ALSO PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING TIPS FOR DETECTING RISK FOR LEFT MAIN OCCLUSION: (1) AORTOGRAM OR TEE PRIOR TO THV IMPLANTATION TO REVEAL BULKY CALCIFIED LEAFLETS; (2) DURING PRE-DILATATION, NOTE BULKY CALCIFICATION ON VALVE MOVING TOWARDS OSTIUM ON LEFT MAIN; AND (3) CONSIDER AORTOGRAM DURING VALVULOPLASTY TO ASSESS CORONARY FLOW.

OTHER BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PATIENTS INCLUDE TOBACCO USE, HYPERTENSION, DIABETES, CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE, ASA CLASS 3 OR 4, DISABLING CLAUDICATION, CRITICAL LIMB ISCHEMIA, TASC A LESION, TASC B LESION.

USER TECHNIQUE- THE ARTICLE STATES, \u00bfRAS [REFRACTORY RADIAL ARTERY SPASM] WAS NOTED AFTER THE ARTERIAL PUNCTURE, IN FOUR PATIENTS, INCLUDING TWO PATIENTS WITH INTRAOPERATIVE RADIAL ARTERY RUPTURE. ON THE BASIS OF OUR EXPERIENCE, RAS MUST BE SUSPECTED WHEN THE OPERATOR FEELS RESISTANCE WHILE INTRODUCING THE FIRST SHEATH OR WHEN THERE IS NO BACKFLOW IN THE SIDEARM OF THE INTRODUCER.\u00bf IT IS LIKELY THAT RAS CONTRIBUTED TO THE LEFT RADIAL ARTERY RUPTURE. THE JOURNAL ARTICLE STATES THAT THE ARTERIAL RUPTURES MIGHT BE RELATED TO THE END-USERS\u00bf \u00bfLEARNING CURVE WITH THIS TECHNIQUE,\u00bf AS ALL COMPLICATIONS WERE SEEN IN THE FIRST 12 PATIENTS OF THE SERIES. COOK DEVICES- 110 CM SHEATHS COULD POTENTIALLY LEAD TO THE FAILURE MODE. THIS INFORMATION IS BASED ON THE INFORMATION PROVIDED ABOVE IN WHICH THE AUTHOR STATES, \\\"RAS MUST BE SUSPECTED WHEN THE OPERATOR FEELS RESISTANCE WHILE INTRODUCING THE FIRST SHEATH OR WHEN THERE IS NO BACKFLOW IN THE SIDEARM OF THE INTRODUCER.\\\" THE SHEATH HAS BEEN INSPECTED BY QC TO CONFIRM CORRECT OVERALL LENGTH, CORRECT SIZE AND TYPE OF TUBING, TO CONFIRM THE DISTAL END OF SHEATH IS SMOOTH AND FREE OF ROUGH EDGES, THE SURFACE OF THE SHEATH IS FREE OF EXCESSIVE DENTS, BUMPS OR SCRATCHES, AND THE TRANSITION AT THE SHEATHS DISTAL END WITH DILATOR IS SMOOTH. THE IFU LISTS INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF THE SHEATH, INCLUDING, \\\"INSERT THE DILATOR COMPLETELY INTO THE INTRODUCER AND, FOR INTRODUCERS WITH TUOHY-BORST VALVES, TIGHTEN THE TUOHY-BORST VALVE AROUND THE DILATOR.

THE FOLLOWING PROCEDURES WERE PERFORMED, 1) L4 AND L5 BILATERAL LAMINECTOMIES. 2) RIGHT-SIDED L4-L5, L5-S1 GILL FACETECTOMIES. 3) LEFT-SIDED L5-S1 GILL FACETECTOMIES. 4) RIGHT-SIDED L4-L5 TRANSFORAMINAL LUMBAR INTERBODY FUSION USING POLYETHERETHERKETONE GRAFT. 5) POSTERIOR SPINAL INSTRUMENTATION WITH PEDICLE SCREW AND ROD FIXATION AT L4, L5 AND S1. 6) ARTHRODESIS, L4 TO S1. 7) USE OF INTRAOPERATIVE RADIOGRAPH. 8) USE OF AUTOGRAFT. 9) USE OF ALLOGRAFT. AS PER OP NOTES, \u00bfWE PROCEEDED TO IDENTIFY THE L4-L5 DISC SPACE ON THE RIGHT USING INTRAOPERATIVE LANDMARKS AND X-RAY. NEXT, AN ANNULOTOMY WITH A #11 SCALPEL WAS PERFORMED AND THEN THE DISC SPACE WAS PREPARED IN THE STANDARD FASHION USING SEQUENTIAL DISC SPACE SCRAPERS. ONCE THE DISC SPACE WAS APPROPRIATELY DISPLAYED AND SIGNIFICANT DISCECTOMY WAS PERFORMED, WE PLACED #11 TRIAL WITHIN THE DISC SPACE AND PERFORMED INTRAOPERATIVE X-RAYS. BASED ON OUR INTRAOPERATIVE X-RAY WE OPTED TO USE A #12 PEEK CAGE. PRIOR TO THIS THE ENDPLATES WERE THEN PREPARED WITH CURETTES AND THE CARTILAGINOUS ENDPLATE WAS REMOVED. THE WOUND WAS THEN COPIOUSLY IRRIGATED, AND THE DISC SPACE WAS THEN PACKED WITH THE PATIENT'S OWN AUTOGRAFT WHICH WAS DEVOID OF SOFT TISSUE AND MORSELIZED.

ONCE WE WERE SATISFIED WITH OUR RADIOGRAPHS WE PROCEEDED WITH PLACEMENT OF OUR PEDICLE SCREWS. AT L4 WE PLACED SIX 5 X 50 MILLIMETER PEDICLE SCREWS BILATERALLY. AT L5 WE PLACED 6.5 X 45 MILLIMETER SCREWS BILATERALLY AND AT S1 WE PLACED 6.5 MILLIMETER X 40 MILLIMETER SCREWS BILATERALLY. NEXT, THE PEDICLE SCREWS' TULIP HEADS WERE THEN CONNECTED WITH A 55 MILLIMETER ROD AND THEN SET SCREWS WERE UTILIZED TO ATTACH THE RODS TO THE TULIP HEADS AND FINAL TIGHTENED TO THE MANUFACTURER'S RECOMMENDED TORQUE LIMITS. AT THIS POINT THE TRANSVERSE PROCESSES OF L4 AND L5 AS WELL AS THE SACRAL ALA OF S1 BILATERALLY WERE DECORTICATED IN PREPARATION FOR OUR ARTHRODESIS.

NEXT, THE PATIENT'S OWN AUTOGRAFT, WHICH WAS MORSELIZED AND DEVOID OF SOFT TISSUE WAS PLACED IN THE LATERAL GUTTERS FOR A POSTEROLATERAL FUSION AND THEN WE PROCEEDED TO PLACE THE ALLOGRAFT IN THE LATERAL GUTTERS TO AID WITH OUR ARTHRODESIS. ONCE WE WERE SATISFIED WITH THIS PORTION OF THE CASE, ONCE AGAIN CONFIRMING X-RAYS WERE OBTAINED IN THE AP AND LATERAL PLANE WHICH REVEALED APPROPRIATE ANATOMIC ALIGNMENT AND HARDWARE PLACEMENT. NEXT, WE TURNED OUR ATTENTION TO THE CLOSURE OF THE WOUND. THE DEEP MUSCLE FASCIA AND SK IN EDGES WERE THEN DOUSED WITH VANCOMYCIN POWDER.\u00bf 15 MAY 2018: PATIENT UNDERWENT X-RAY OF LUMBAR SPINE.

(B)(6), JR., MD. OPERATIVE REPORT. SURGEON:(B)(6) MD. FIRST ASSISTANT: KENNETH P. KLEINPETER, JR., MD. PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: INCISIONAL HERNIA. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: INCARCERATION INCISIONAL HERNIA, EXTENSIVE SEVERE INTRA-ABDOMINAL ADHESIONS. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: LAPAROSCOPIC REPAIR OF AN INCARCERATED INCISIONAL HERNIA. DEFECT MEASURED 10 X 15 CM. WE USED AN 18 X 24 CM PIECE OF GORE DUALMESH PLUS PROSTHESIS AND 10 TRANSFASCIAL SUTURES. EXTENSIVE LAPAROSCOPIC ADHESIOLYSIS REQUIRING TWO HOURS TO PERFORM. ANESTHESIA: GENERAL ENDOTRACHEAL. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: \u00bfMS. GILL WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE OPERATING SUITE AT WHICH TIME A TIMEOUT WAS PERFORMED TO CONFIRM IDENTITY, PROCEDURE, INCISION SITE, ANTIBIOTIC ADMINISTRATION AND OTHER DETAILS PERTINENT TO THE CASE. ONCE THIS HAD BEEN ACHIEVED, WE BEGAN. A RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT 5-MM INCISION WAS MADE TO ACCOMMODATE A SMOOTH BLADELESS APPLIED TROCAR WHICH WAS INSERTED UNDER OPTICAL GUIDANCE. ONCE IN THE PERITONEAL CAVITY, WE INSUFFLATED AND INSPECTED THE CONTENTS OF THE PERITONEAL CAVITY. THERE WERE EXTENSIVE ADHESIONS WITH SMALL BOWEL INCARCERATED WITHIN THE HERNIAL DEFECT AS WELL AS THE SUPERIOR MOST PORTION OF THE INCISION. WE WERE ABLE TO PLACE A LEFT UPPER QUADRANT TROCAR UNDER DIRECT VISUALIZATION, THEN PLACED A LEFT LOWER QUADRANT TROCAR SO THAT WE WORKED THROUGH FOUR WORKING PORTS. ALL THESE WERE PLACED UNDER DIRECT VISUALIZATION. NO EVIDENCE OF UNDERLYING BLOOD VESSEL OR BOWEL INJURY RELATED TO INSERTION. ONCE THIS WAS COMPLETE, WE BEGAN AN EXTENSIVE AND TEDIOUS DISSECTION OF OMENTAL ADHESIONS AND ADHESIONS OF SMALL BOWEL TO THE ANTERIOR ABDOMINAL WALL AND WITHIN THE HERNIA SAC. WE TOOK GREAT CARE NOT TO INJURY THE BOWEL THROUGH THIS PROCESS AND INSPECTED AND RE-INSPECTED THE SMALL BOWEL WHICH WAS INVOLVED MULTIPLE TIMES THROUGHOUT THE CASE TO ENSURE THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF INJURY, BILE LEAK OR HEMORRHAGE. ONCE WE COMPLETED THE DISSECTION, WE FOUND TWO HERNIA DEFECTS WHICH IN THEIR GREATEST DIMENSIONS TOGETHER MEASURED 15 CM IN THE VERTICAL PLAN, 10 CM IN THE HORIZONTAL PLANE. THEREFORE, WE ELECTED TO OBTAIN AN 18 X 24 PROSTHESIS FOR A BROAD ENOUGH UNDERLAY OF ALL THESE DEFECTS. WE PLACED THIS WITHIN THE PERITONEAL CAVITY AFTER PREPARING WITH SUTURES ABOVE AND BELOW SUPERIORLY AND INFERIORLY. WE BROUGHT THESE TWO SUTURES OUT THROUGH TRANSFASCIAL STAB INCISIONS AND TIED THE KNOTS LAYING MESH TAUT WITH ROUGH FACING THE ANTERIOR ABDOMINAL WALL, SMOOTH SIDE FACING THE VISCERA. WE THEN USED A DAVOL SALUTE FIXATION DEVICE TO CIRCUMFERENTIALLY IN A DOUBLE CROWN TECHNIQUE AFFIX THE MESH TO THE ANTERIOR ABDOMINAL WALL. WE THEN PLACED EIGHT OTHER TRANSFASCIAL SUTURES WITH APPROXIMATELY 5 CM SPACING BETWEEN EACH AND TIED ALL THESE IN PLACE. THIS LAID OUT THE MESH NICELY AND AT THE TERMINATION OF THIS WE RE-INSPECTED THE CONTENTS OF THE PERITONEAL CAVITY ONCE MORE. THERE WAS NO ACTIVE HEMORRHAGE, NO EVIDENCE OF ENTERIC INJURY. THE PATIENT TOLERATED THE PROCEDURE WELL AND ALL SPONGE AND NEEDLES COUNTS WERE CORRECT. WE DEFLATED THE ABDOMEN. WE REMOVED ALL TROCARS. WE CLOSED THE SITES WITH 4-0 MONOCRYL SUTURES AND STERI-STRIPS. THE PATIENT WAS TRANSFERRED TO POST ANESTHESIA CARE UNIT IN STABLE CONDITION.\u00bf (B)(6) 2008: OUR LADY OF THE LAKE REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER. IMPLANT STICKER. GORE DUALMESH\u00ae PLUS BIOMATERIAL.

INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: \u00bfTHIS IS A 61-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WHO PRESENTED TO OUR LADY OF THE LAKE ER WITH COMPLAINTS OF A BOWEL OBSTRUCTION. A CT SCAN SHOWED A RECURRENT VENTRAL HERNIA WITH THE TRANSITION POINT WITHIN THE HERNIA SAC ITSELF. AFTER DISCUSSING THE RISKS AND BENEFITS OF LAPAROSCOPIC VERSUS OPEN REPAIR, SHE ELECTED TO PROCEED. OPERATIVE FINDINGS: THE PATIENT HAD MULTIPLE ABDOMINAL WALL ADHESIONS REQUIRING APPROXIMATELY 3 HOURS OF LAPAROSCOPIC LYSIS OF ADHESIONS. SHE HAD AN APPROXIMATELY 2 X 4 CM DEFECT ON THE RIGHT LATERAL WALL OF HER PREVIOUSLY PLACED MESH. SHE DID HAVE INCARCERATED BOWEL WITHIN THIS HERNIA DEFECT THAT WAS CAREFULLY DISSECTED FREE. DESPITE THE LONG LYSIS OF ADHESIONS, THE BOWEL WAS INSPECTED MULTIPLE TIMES AND NO BOWEL INJURIES WERE IDENTIFIED. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: AFTER INFORMED CONSENT WAS OBTAINED, THE PATIENT WAS TAKEN TO THE OPERATING ROOM, PLACED ON THE OPERATING TABLE IN A SUPINE POSITION, AND GENERAL ENDOTRACHEAL ANESTHESIA WAS OBTAINED. ABDOMEN WAS PREPPED AND DRAPED IN A SURGICAL STERILE FASHION. TIME-OUT WAS PERFORMED CONFIRMING PATIENT AND PROCEDURE. PREOPERATIVE ANTIBIOTICS AND DVT PROPHYLAXIS WERE GIVEN. ABDOMEN WAS ENTERED THROUGH AN INCISION IN THE RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT. USING A 5 MM OPTICAL TROCAR, ABDOMEN WAS INSUFFLATED TO A PRESSURE OF 15. CAMERA INSERTED. NO INTRA-ABDOMINAL INJURY NOTED. MULTIPLE ADHESIONS WERE NOTED TO THE ANTERIOR ABDOMINAL WALL AND WE INITIALLY PLACED 2 ADDITIONAL 5 MM TROCARS IN THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE ABDOMEN AND BEGAN TAKING DOWN THE ADHESIONS.
